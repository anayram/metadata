She is one of Quebec's most-translated authors into English. Anne Hébert is a rarity in Canadian literature, as there has been a multiplicity of translations of her poetry. Indeed, there are five major (F.R. Scott, Peter Miller, Allan Brown, Alfred Poulin Jr., Lola Lemire Tostevin) and eleven minor (Graham Dunstan Martin, Fred Cogswell, Gwaldys Downes, John Glassco, G.R. Roy, Ralph Gustafson, Aliki and Willis Barnstone, Kathleen Weaver, Janis Pallister, Daniel Sloate, Maxine Kuman) translators of her poetry. She is also one of the most anthologized poets from French Canada. Moreover, the process of translating Hébert's poetry has also left in its wake a number of archival resources that chronicle the individual acts of translation. All of these materials are invaluable in understanding the systems in place that influence the mediated process that is translation. This dissertation ""deals with those in the middle"", those who are responsible for Anne Hébert's image as a poet in English. It is a narrative history on the evolution of her image as a poet in English."									"100307s2007\\\\xx\\\\\\\bm\\\000\0\eng\d"
