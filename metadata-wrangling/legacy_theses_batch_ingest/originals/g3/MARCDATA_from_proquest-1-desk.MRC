These little magazines, over 300 of which emerged between 1894 and 1904, represented a prolific and significant body of alternative print culture and are central to the literary and social history of this period. The thesis documents the social and cultural origins of the form and its producers; describes the material conditions of production, distribution, and reception governing their emergence; explores the literary and social networks of the people that produced them; and provides an overview of the main types of these magazines ("aesthetic," "protest," "humor and parody," and "miscellaneous") and their typical content. An updated bibliography of these magazines, which have not been fully documented since 1903, is included.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aLibrary Science. 4aJournalism.  a0399  a039120aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg48-03.  a0351  aM.L.I.S.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR5415502019nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002400129245006300153300001100216500007200227502005700299520099200356590002301348650002801371650002001399690000901419690000901428710003601437773004401473790000901517791000901526792000901535793001201544856014901556AAIMR5460920150317073515.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494546093  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR54609  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBrown, Ryan George.10aClimate, culture, and the environment in northern Iceland.  a146 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 48-03, page: 1362.  aThesis (M.A.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aThis thesis is an anthropological study of how various groups of Icelanders express and contextualize qualitative analytical themes in relation to climate change. To identify these cultural themes I carried out fieldwork in northern Iceland and interviewed people about their concerns with the cultural impacts of climate change. The cultural impacts to which I refer are socioeconomic, political, and environmental issues being caused by, or existing issues being compounded by, climate change in Iceland. I analyzed these themes to elucidate interconnections between climate, culture, and the environment in Iceland. From an anthropological perspective, Iceland provides an interesting contrast to a majority of current social scientific approaches to the human dimensions of Arctic climate change research. The preliminary results of the ethnographic research I conducted in Iceland demonstrate that views of climate change by Icelanders are multiple, both optimistic and pessimistic.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aAnthropology, Cultural. 4aClimate Change.  a0326  a040420aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg48-03.  a0351  aM.A.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR5460902011nam a2200361   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002100129245008200150300001100232500007200243502005700315520087000372590002301242650002801265650001501293650002201308650001501330690000901345690000901354690000901363690000901372710003601381773004401417790000901461791000901470792000901479793001201488856014901500AAIMR5461220150317073516.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494546123  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR54612  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChia, Yueh Jean.10aPicturing Calgary: An analysis of a collaborative, urban photography project.  a198 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 48-03, page: 1362.  aThesis (M.A.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aThis thesis examines the experiences of residents new to Calgary through their participation in a collaborative photography project named "Picturing Calgary." Within the framework of this project, participants explored the city and documented their reflections on it, addressing a fundamentally ontological question: how is being new conceived, and what are the routes to place-making for those new to a city? The results of this study afford both an understanding of how place-making is constituted, and how people come to identify with place. Further, this thesis demonstrates that the establishment of discursive and critically reflective spaces can facilitate ownership of new places. Despite the creation of such social spaces, there is a perceptible void of social spaces approximating public life---an aspect particularly salient for residents new to a city.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aAnthropology, Cultural. 4aFine Arts. 4aCanadian Studies. 4aGeography.  a0326  a0357  a0385  a036620aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg48-03.  a0351  aM.A.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR5461202027nam a2200337   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002600129245007800155300001100233500007200244502005700316520091200373590002301285650003001308650002101338650003501359690000901394690000901403690000901412710003601421773004401457790000901501791000901510792000901519793001201528856014901540AAIMR5463220150317073516.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494546321  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR54632  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMartin, Heather Anne.10aChildbearing women in a rural Ghanaian community---a focused ethnography.  a101 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 48-03, page: 1593.  aThesis (M.N.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aMaternal mortality is a highly preventable cause of death but continues to be the health indicator that shows the greatest disparity between high and low income countries. Rural Ghana has estimated maternal mortality rates as high as 1077/100,000 whereas the global estimate is 402/100,000. Much research has been carried out to understand what influences maternal health and the causes of maternal morbidity and mortality in low-income countries. This focused ethnography, conducted in a rural Ghanaian town between April and June of 2008, adds to the literature by exploring the community members' perspectives of maternal health. The researcher gained insights into the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs that influence the type and amount of support received by childbearing women in a selected community and offers insights into the cultural practices and beliefs that support or inhibit maternal health.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Nursing. 4aWomen's Studies. 4aHealth Sciences, Epidemiology.  a0569  a0453  a076620aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg48-03.  a0351  aM.N.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR5463202347nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002100129245015700150300001100307500007200318502005800390520061000448520058801058590002301646650002501669650004001694690000901734690000901743710003601752773004401788790000901832791001001841792000901851793001201860856014901872AAIMR5571020150317073516.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494557105  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR55710  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHunting, Wesley.12aA taxonomic revision of the Cymindis ( Pinacodera) limbata species group (Coleoptera: Carabidae: Lebiini), with notes about evolutionary considerations.  a164 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 48-03, page: 1523.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aThe Cymindis (Pinacodera)  limbata species group (Coleoptera: Carabidae, Lebiini) is a precinctive New World taxon with ranges extending from portions of temperate southeastern Canada and the U.S.A., through the montane regions of Mexico, south to the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The group is distinguished from all other members of the subgenus Pinacodera by having males with a distinctive sclerite (endophallic plate) at the apex of the everted endophallus. A lack of material and misunderstandings of range of variation within species have contributed to confusion about how many species there really are.  aThis revision of the limbata species group includes a classification, a key to groups within the subgenus Pinacodera and species within the limbata group, decriptions of species, re-rankings and new synonomies. In total 9 taxa are treated, with 9 new synonomies proposed, and 6 new combinations introduced. Each taxon is characterized in terms of structural features of adults, habitat, geographical distribution, and chorological affinities. Where possible, ecological information is also included.

The Kremlin's alignment with the epicenter of the Arab world permitted the articulation of military, political and economic objectives designed to enhance its own power and prestige, while erode that of the United States. This research demonstrates that the Moscow-Cairo nexus was of greater scope than hitherto recognized by the scholarly community. Certainly, political and military acrimony between the Arabs and the Israelis provided the Kremlin a timely entree into regional affairs. Yet, to frame Soviet-Egyptian relations by this variable has limited both our understanding of and the benefits accrued to Moscow from its relationship with Cairo. Ultimately, the scholarly community views the Soviet Union under Brezhnev as a conservative and status-quo global actor infected with gerontocratic malaise. This thesis reveals that the Brezhnevian Politburo was far from conservative; rather, it was opportunistic and aggressive.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHistory, Modern. 4aHistory, Russian and Soviet. 4aHistory, Middle Eastern. 4aHistory, African. 4aPolitical Science, International Relations.  a0582  a0724  a0333  a0331  a060120aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg48-03.  a0351  aM.A.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR5573801902nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002900129245003700158300001100195500007200206502005800278520095200336590002301288650002301311690000901334710003601343773004401379790000901423791001001432792000901442793001201451856014901463AAIMR7124220150317073516.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712429  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR71242  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSawatzky, Luanne Gloria.10aSCO1: A role in redox chemistry?  a137 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 49-04, page: 2336.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aCytochrome c oxidase (COX) assembly is very complex, and approximately 30 nuclear-encoded proteins are required to correctly assemble COX. The absence of any of these assembly factors results in a non-functional and misassembled COX. Yeast Sco1p was originally identified as being essential for COX assembly and the formation of the CUA site. However, the presence of a thioredoxin-like fold in the crystal structures of Sco proteins from humans, yeast and Bacillus subtilis sparked debate regarding the role of Sco1p as a copper chaperone. My data demonstrate that Sco1p may be associated with a peroxidase activity that increases when Sco1p expression is increased, requires fully assembled COX and is inhibited by copper sulfate. This activity requires specific cellular conditions and appears to be connected to mitochondrial peroxide metabolism.

Pearson correlations, partial correlations and regression were performed to determine the strength of the relationships between moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), BMI/waist circumference and insulin sensitivity.  aResults: MVPA minutes/day and 8MI was negatively correlated in females and males (r = -0.244, p<0.001; r = -0.258, p=0.001 respectively) even after controlling for age (r = -0.215, p<0.001; r = -0.220, p=0.005). The correlation between MVPA minutes/day and waist circumference was comparable to the correlation between MVPA and BMI. MVPA minutes/day and insulin sensitivity were positively correlated associated using the Pearson correlation, however, after controlling for BMI, age and gender the association became negative (r = -0.087, p=0.064).  aConclusion: In a cohort of youth, aged 9 to 15, both anthropometric measures and insulin sensitivity were associated with MVPA.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Recreation.  a057520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg49-04.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR7124302106nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002000129245015700149300001100306500007200317502005800389520102400447590002301471650004401494690000901538710003601547773004401583790000901627791001001636792000901646793001201655856014901667AAIMR7124420150317073516.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712443  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR71244  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aViens, Chantal.10aDiversite et minorite: pistes pour soutenir et orienter la mise en oeuvre de la differenciation pedagogique en milieu francophone minoritaire albertain.  a114 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 49-04, page: 2129.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aThis theoretical study concerns the Francophone population educated in Alberta through the Conseil scolaire du Centre-Nord (CSCN). It outlines various options that can be used to orient and assist teachers with the implementation of differentiated learning in this context. The first part of this study identifies the characteristics of the diversity that has emerged within the demographic served by the CSCN. In response to the needs created by this new diversity, its second part then proposes differentiated learning concepts to guide teachers tasked with managing changing heterogeneous classroom and school settings. Given the numerous perspectives on differentiated learning, the study explores the contributions of various experts in the area in order to select the most appropriate theoretical concepts for understanding and addressing the new realities in order to provide an array of best-practices that can be used to understand and support the challenges present in the Francophone educational environment.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEducation, Bilingual and Multicultural.  a028220aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg49-04.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR7124402204nam a2200337   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002700129245006500156300001000221500007200231502005800303520041200361520048300773520022701256590002301483650004001506650003301546690000901579690000901588710003601597773004401633790000901677791001001686792000901696793001201705856014901717AAIMR7125120150317073516.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712511  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR71251  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKamelchuk, David Paul.10aEffects of fertilization on hybrid and native poplar clones.  a87 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 49-04, page: 2302.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aTrees of four poplar clones were grown for two years on an agricultural field (54&deg;N, 112&deg;W, elevation 620 m) and fertilized at planting with 27.9 g of nitrogen (N) or 83.4 g of NPKSCuZn (NPK+). Growth response to the fertilizer treatments varied between treatments and clones throughout the experiment. After two years height, basal diameter and leaf area differed significantly with control<N<NPK+.  aLeaf N (% dry weight) was significantly affected by fertilizer treatment and clone in both years with an overall trend of leaf N increasing from control to N to NPK+ treatments. Generally leaf P and K (% dry weight) were also significantly affected by fertilizer treatment and clone. Comparison of nutrient levels in the harvested whole trees versus sample tree leaves collected from the actively growing terminal leaders showed significant differences in several key nutrients.  aOverall the results indicate that nutrients supplied by the fertilizer treatments were taken up by the target trees, increasing leaf tissue levels resulting in increased leaf area and mass and overall biomass accumulation.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aAgriculture, Forestry and Wildlife. 4aNatural Resource Management.  a0478  a052820aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg49-04.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR7125102492nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002600129245006500155300001100220500007200231502005800303520151100361590002301872650002901895690000901924710003601933773004401969790000902013791001002022792000902032793001202041856014902053AAIMR7126120150317073517.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712610  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR71261  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJanowicz, Aleksandra.10aStructural and Functional Analysis of Calreticulin P-domain.  a103 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 49-04, page: 2490.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aCalreticulin is a Ca2+-binding chaperone that resides in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum and is involved in the regulation of intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and in the folding of newly synthesized glycoproteins. In the ER lumen, Calreticulin cooperates with another chaperone, its close homolog, Calnexin and a thiol oxidoreductase, ERp57 in the "quality control system" during the protein folding process, ERp57 binds to the tip of Calreticulin P-domain. In my thesis, I have used site-specific mutagenesis to change amino acid residues in the P-domain repeat regions that may be involved in interactions with ERp57. Mutations, substitutions into alanines, were designed to disrupt the characteristic beta-sheet structures within the P-domain. Purified wild type Calreticulin and P-domain mutant proteins were examined using standard bio-molecular assays including limited trypsin digestion and intrinsic fluorescence to determine significant conformational changes in mutated proteins comparing to wild type Calreticulin. Malate dehydrogenase (MOH) thermal aggregation assay results suggest that P-domain repeat regions mutations do not have any significant impact on the chaperone function of Calreticulin. Surface plasmon resonance analysis revealed that two particular mutations in P-domain repeat regions: 207KID209-AAA and 189KKIK192-AAAA, significantly enhanced the ERp57 binding capacity of Calreticulin suggesting that those regions are involved in interactions between those two proteins.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aChemistry, Biochemistry.  a048720aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg49-04.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR7126102603nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002500129245011900154300001000273500007200283502005800355520157700413590002301990650002202013690000902035710003602044773004402080790000902124791001002133792000902143793001202152856014902164AAIMR7127220150317073517.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712726  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR71272  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRavanbakhsh, Mohsen.12aA Stochastic Optimization Method for Partially Decomposable Problems, with Application to Analysis of NMR Spectra.  a59 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 49-04, page: 2535.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aMany real-life optimization problems have structures that one may be able to exploit to solve the problem efficiently. A common structure is  partial decomposability, which decomposes the original problem into a set of weakly coupled sub-problems that are each relatively easy to solve. However, due to the coupling, the solution to each sub-problem must also incorporate information from the other sub-problems. We designed the Cross Entropy method Exploiting (partial) Decomposability (CEED) to address such problems, especially analyzing 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra of mixtures. This analysis involves finding the concentration of chemicals in a complex liquid mixture. Each chemical's signature is a set of clusters of peaks, that shift horizontally in a bounded domain and scale vertically proportional to the chemical's concentration. Therefore when each chemical's signature is known, the task is to best match a nonlinear model, by finding appropriate shift and concentration values. This could be formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem involving hundreds of variables. Since chemical signatures have 'local' effects on each other, the problem is decomposable to loosely coupled sub-problems that are easier to solve. Experimental results show superior performance of CEED to other common optimization methods as well as a state-of-the-art systems for analysis of NMR. We also apply CEED to the SAT and Sudoku combinatorial optimization problems to show the generality of our method and its superiority to the original Cross Entropy method.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aComputer Science.  a098420aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg49-04.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR7127202477nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002300129245005300152300001100205500007200216502005800288520051800346520037400864520059901238590002301837650002501860690000901885710003601894773004401930790000901974791001001983792000901993793001202002856014902014AAIMR7127820150317073517.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712788  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR71278  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAgarwal, Jitender.10aCyclic load-deformation performance of oil sand.  a146 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 49-04, page: 2703.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aThe oil sand surface beneath ultra class mining equipment such as an in-pit crusher deforms highly due to the combined effect of crusher weight, operational vibrations and cyclic loading while crushing material during operation. These loading conditions result in ground deformation, cyclically changing the geotechnical response of the ground. An improved study of equipment-ground interaction is required to better understand the deterioration of ground conditions beneath such equipment for adequate operation.  aA simple cyclic plate load test was conducted for 3 rectangular plates of varying size and a circular plate on oil sand and sand to investigate the effect of footprint size and shape on ground response. Combinations of 4 frequencies and 4 load levels were applied during the tests to correlate force-deformation characteristics by loading frequency and footprint shape.  aA shape factor was determined considering the depth of loading influence response and the size of the plates. Based on the force-deformation response, an empirical correlation was discerned relating load, deformation and shape factor. This correlation allows prediction of oil sand deformation under nominal loading by a tracked machine during in-pit positioning prior to operation. Also, an empirical relationship was estimated between oil sand stiffness and number of loading cycles. This relationship allows prediction of the oil sand deformation during cyclic loading by the same equipment.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEngineering, Mining.  a055120aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg49-04.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR7127802078nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002800129245010100157300001100258500007200269502005700341520100600398590002301404650002201427650003001449690000901479690000901488710003601497773004401533790000901577791000901586792000901595793001101604856014901615AAIMR7128020150317073517.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||fre d  a9780494712801  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR71280  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCloutier, Marie-Nicole.10aExperiences des aidants naturels francophones de la region d'Edmonton: Une analyse exploratoire.  a114 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 49-04, page: 2213.  aThesis (M.A.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aThis project describes and analyses the experiences of francophone family care giving, in a minority situation. In the context of ambulatory care, more and more family members provide long term care to a loved one who has loss of physical or functional autonomy. Literature published on family care giving demonstrates that family caregivers do not have an official status within our health care system, and often lack adequate practical, financial and emotional support. These challenges that the participants of this project face are exaggerated by a minority context where one finds little or no services in French. Using a qualitative method of Narrative Inquiry proposed by Clandinin and Conelly, six Franco-Albertan family caregivers were interviewed to meet the objectives of this thesis which were to allow these francophone caregivers to discuss their perceptions regarding the loss of autonomy of a family member, their role and the health services received at the moment of this transition.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aCanadian Studies. 4aHealth Sciences, Nursing.  a0385  a056920aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg49-04.  a0351  aM.A.  a2010  aFrench  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR7128002054nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002500129245015500154300001100309500007200320502005800392520091200450590002301362650003201385650003601417690000901453690000901462710003601471773004401507790000901551791001001560792000901570793001201579856014901591AAIMR8097820150317073517.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494809785  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR80978  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFajer Gomez, Mariel.10aUse of Natural Health Products among pregnant women in Alberta: A preliminary analysis of the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) cohort.  a103 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 1726.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aNatural Health Products (NHPs) contribute to micronutrient intake during pregnancy.

Intake of NHPs contributed significantly to meeting micronutrient requirements in pregnancy.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Nutrition. 4aHealth Sciences, Public Health.  a0570  a057320aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8097801993nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001400129245007900143300001100222500007200233502005800305520101600363590002301379650002301402690000901425710003601434773004401470790000901514791001001523792000901533793001201542856014901554AAIMR8098120150317073517.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494809815  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR80981  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLi, Yisu.10aCharacterization of PAX3 target genes and its roles in malignant melanoma.  a153 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 1621.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aPAX3 plays important roles in development, postnatally, and in multiple diseases. PAX3 contains two DNA-binding domains: paired domain (PD) and homeodomain (HD). To understand their role in target gene recognition, known PAX3 targets were analyzed in silico. This revealed that only sites containing both PD and HD recognition motifs met criteria of phylogenetic conservation and efficient binding. Motif analyses also indicated that these composite sites were over-represented in genomic fragments recovered based on PAX3 binding. Therefore, the composite sequence was used for  de novo discovery of PAX3 targets. A genome scan identified three target genes relevant to PAX3 biology: BOC, PRDM12 and  LBX1. Lastly, analyses of PAX3 in melanoma revealed that its expression was cell cycle regulated and that attenuation of PAX3 in mouse melanoma cells caused a significant reduction in cell number due to G0/G1 accumulation. My results improve understanding of PAX3 regulatory behavior and its role in melanoma.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Genetics.  a036920aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8098102004nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001800129245007100147300001100218500007200229500002800301502005800329520031700387520065600704590002301360650002901383690000901412710003601421773004401457790000901501791001001510792000901520793001201529856014901541AAIMR8126920150317073517.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494812693  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR81269  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBoyd, Curtis.13aAn Evaluation of the Returns to Research in Field Peas and Canola.  a283 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 1481.  aAdviser: Ellen Goddard.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aThe agricultural industry has seen reduced levels of government expenditures for research and development (R&D) since the 1980s. In light of fiscal restraints and societies' need for increasing food production, it is important to demonstrate the degree to which support to agricultural R&D has benefited society.  aIn this study the research environment in Canada is reviewed with a particular focus on structural changes, including the recent introduction of the Plant Breeders Rights (PBR) act. Returns to research in the Canadian canola and field pea sector are examined at the national and provincial (i.e. Alberta) levels. An economic surplus approach is used to assess research gains and research is modeled to impact total supply as well as yield and acreage separately to establish robustness of results. Yield enhancements derived from research have benefited less than expected, accounting for 9% of total benefits in field peas and 33% in Canadian canola.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEconomics, Agricultural.  a050320aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8126902073nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002100129245009400150300001000244500007200254500002700326502005700353520096200410590002301372650004201395650002401437690000901461690000901470710003601479773004401515790000901559791000901568792000901577793001201586856014901598AAIMR8128120150317073517.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494812815  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR81281  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAu Yong, Ke-Xin.10aQin Jiushao and His "Mathematical Treatise in Nine Sections" in Thirteenth-Century China.  a87 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 1495.  aAdviser: Jennifer Jay.  aThesis (M.A.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aResearching Qin Jiushao (ca. 1202 -- 1261), a mathematician in Southern Song China, presents several difficulties for the historian. Qin Jiushao now suffers from a very controversial image in historiography due to the nature of our sources. This study presents a re-evaluation of existing sources and proposes that Qin's image should be rehabilitated. Qin's treatise, the Shushu jiuzhang, marks the beginning of the maturation of Chinese algebra, and as such, it has great mathematical and historical significance. Its influence was also apparent in Korea. Although there can be no question as to the importance of the Shushu jiuzhang in the history of Chinese mathematics and of mathematical development worldwide, it is difficult to explain why its influence remained almost nil for six centuries after it was completed. I will argue that one of the primary reasons was the lack of state support for mathematical education since the Southern Song dynasty.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHistory, Asia, Australia and Oceania. 4aHistory of Science.  a0332  a058520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.A.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8128102227nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001400129245019300143300001100336500007200347500003000419502005800449520035900507520053400866520017101400590002301571650002901594690000901623710003601632773004401668790000901712791001001721792000901731793001201740856014901752AAIMR8129920150317073518.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494812990  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR81299  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLi, Tete.10aIncreased expression of regulator of G protein signaling 2 explains how choline supplementation increases visceral fat mass in phosphatidylethanolamine  N-methyltransferase deficient mice.  a100 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 1775.  aAdviser: Dennis E.

Pemt-/- mice exhibited reduced weight gain and visceral fat mass after being fed the high fat (HF) diet for 1 week. Surprisingly, dietary choline supplementation reversed the phenotype of Pemt-/- mice fed the HF diet.  aCompared to Pemt-/- mice, Pemt -/- mice had reduced amount of choline in plasma, liver and gastrocnemius muscle after fed the HF diet. Gonadal fat pads from  Pemt-/- mice took up less oleate for triglyceride (TG) biosynthesis and exhibited increased lipolysis. However, choline supplementation reduced lipolysis and induced the expression of regulator of G protein signaling 2 (RGS2) in the fat pads of Pemt-/- mice. RGS2 can attenuate beta-adrenergic signaling that is the primary initiator of TG mobilization in adipose tissue.  aHence, we hypothesize that increased expression of RGS2 would present a potential mechanism for how choline supplementation revered visceral fat mass in Pemt-/- mice.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aChemistry, Biochemistry.  a048720aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8129902039nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002500129245008200154300001100236500007200247500002700319502005800346520095500404590002301359650002601382650001801408690000901426690000901435710003601444773004401480790000901524791001001533792000901543793001201552856014901564AAIMR8130020150317073518.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494813003  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR81300  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aDunning, Hayley Ann.10aExtending the applications of tephrochronology in Northwestern North America.  a187 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 1684.  aAdviser: Duane Froese.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aMajor-element geochemistry, stratigraphy and Bayesian statistical age modeling are combined with the aim of integrating paleoclimate records. The goal is to create a tephrochronological framework for northwestern North America. The coastal region of southeastern Alaska is explored through a terrestrial peat core and a marine core. The widespread Mount Edgecumbe dacite (MEd) is identified in both cores. The age of the MEd is modeled between 13,270 - 13,050 cal yrs BP. This date is used to estimate the marine reservoir for this area; approximately 320 -- 810 years. Four sulphate peaks from the PR Col ice core from Mt Logan are investigated for associated cryptotephras. The expected tephras are found for White River East and Aniakchak events, and possible correlations are found for White River North and Hayes Tephra Set H events. The PR Col age model for these tephras is tested against terrestrial age estimations, and shows good agreement.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aPaleoclimate Science. 4aGeochemistry.  a0653  a099620aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8130002540nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001800129245009200147300001100239500007200250500004800322502005800370520142300428590002301851650002501874650002801899690000901927690000901936710003601945773004401981790000902025791001002034792000902044793001202053856014902065AAIMR8130320150317073518.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494813034  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR81303  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aGupta, Manuj.10aDiscrete element modeling of the cable shovel dipper for efficient digging in oilsands.  a109 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 1970.  aAdvisers: Jozef Szymanski; Peter Schiavone.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aThe cable shovels working in Alberta oil sand deposits have to mine different materials having different physical properties. The pitch brace and tooth-adaptor is an important shovel dipper component which can influence the rake angle of the dipper. To get the best productivity from the dipper an optimum combination of pitch brace length and tooth-adaptor angle is required based on the material dipper is digging. As the field trials are very expensive and time consuming option to test the performance of the various pitch brace lengths and tooth-adaptor angles, a discrete element model for the shovel digging was proposed. Discrete element modeling is a useful tool to model the granular flows. A wedge penetration tests were performed in the laboratory on three different types of material. The reaction force curves obtained from the wedge penetration tests were then used to calibrate the discrete element model. Once the discrete element model was developed it was used to predict the digging outcomes for various pitch brace lengths and tooth-adaptor angle configurations. In total 35 pitch brace lengths and tooth-adaptor angle configurations were considered for simulating the cable shovel digging. It was concluded that the top 5 pitch brace length and tooth-adaptor angle configurations, predicted from discrete element model, have a potential to improve the shovel productivity in range of 0.4 to 0.9%.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEngineering, Mining. 4aEngineering, Petroleum.  a0551  a076520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8130302302nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001900129245012500148300001000273500007200283500003400355502005800389520114900447590002301596650003101619650003901650690000901689690000901698710003601707773004401743790000901787791001001796792000901806793001201815856014901827AAIMR8130420150317073518.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494813041  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR81304  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHosan, Naheed.10aChildren's student-teacher relationships, friendships and school engagement: Trajectories of change in middle childhood.  a62 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 2011.  aAdviser: Wendy L.

However, the direction of these associations is unclear. This study examines the covariation between relationship quality and school engagement over time, and gender differences in these associations. Participants were 461 kindergarten to third-grade children. Data on student-teacher relationship quality, friendship caring and conflict, and emotional and behavioral school engagement were collected 3 times over 6 months. Relationship quality and school engagement were correlated at baseline. Initial levels of student-teacher relationship quality contributed to growth in emotional engagement. Unexpectedly, initial levels of emotional engagement contributed to fewer decreases in friendship conflict and initial levels of friendship conflict contributed to growth in behavioural engagement. Growth in friendship conflict also covaried negatively over time with growth in behavioural engagement. No other associations or gender differences were significant. Implications of these findings are discussed.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aPsychology, Developmental. 4aEducation, Educational Psychology.  a0620  a052520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8130402037nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001700129245003900146300001000185500007200195502005800267520109400325590002301419650002701442690000901469710003601478773004401514790000901558791001001567792000901577793001201586856014901598AAIMR8131220150317073518.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494813126  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR81312  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiang, Chen.10aSelectivity in Ion Chromatography.  a95 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 50-03, page: 1770.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aThe factors affecting selectivity in ion chromatography (IC) are explored. Chapter 2 details preliminary studies of selectivity using silica monolithic columns coated with two different surfactants. The effect of eluent strength and capacity on retention and selectivity were compared. The more hydrophilic surfactant, ODAC1-coated column displayed changes in retention and selectivity comparing from CTAB. However, stability issues limited further investigations. Chapter 3 investigates the selectivity of commercial IC columns using the Virtual Column database. The reversed phase character (i.e., hydrophobicity) and hydroxide eluent strength on each of the columns were quantified. The manufacturer's "hydrophobicities" do not correlate with the reversed phase character of the columns but rather reflect the effective hydroxide eluent strength on the columns. Column selectivity for organic anions correlates with the reversed phase character of the IC columns but inorganic anions do not correlate with either the reversed phase character or hydroxide eluent strength of the columns.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aChemistry, Analytical.  a048620aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg50-03.  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8131202242nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001800129245010500147300001100252500006000263502005700323520045800380520066000838590002301498650002701521650002801548690000901576690000901585710008701594773004701681790000901728791000901737792000901746793001201755856014901767AAIMR8512820150317073518.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494851289  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR85128  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aTseng, Henry.10aStudy on the Role of a Cationic Organic Dispersant in Bitumen Recovery from Mineable Oil Sands Ores.  a106 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 51-05.  aThesis (M.S.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aThe presence of fines deteriorates both bitumen recovery and froth quality due to slime coatings and entrainment of fines into the froth during bitumen extraction from oil sands. This thesis aims to understand the role of a commercially available cationic organic dispersant (COD) in bitumen flotation from mineable oil sands. COD dosage at 300 ppm was found to improve bitumen froth quality over 30% with a marginal reduction of 5% in bitumen recovery.  aAdsorption of the COD on both bitumen and kaolinite clay fines were confirmed by zeta--potential and QCM-D measurements. COD has a stronger affinity to fines than to bitumen based on the larger increment in zeta--potential value and the higher adsorption density of clays. COD adsorption makes the bitumen surface become less hydrophobic with a reduction in contact angle and an increase in the induction time between air bubble and bitumen. The improvement of bitumen froth quality was mainly attributed to the change in surface wettability of the oil sands solids due to COD adsorption, which led to a decrease in the hydrophobicity of oil sands solids.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEngineering, Chemical. 4aEngineering, Petroleum.  a0542  a076520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).bDepartment of Chemical and Materials Engineering.0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-05(E).  a0351  aM.S.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8512802131nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002000129245012200149300001000271500006000281500005100341502005800392520104200450590002301492650003301515690000901548710003601557773004701593790000901640791001001649792000901659793001201668856014901680AAIMR8786120150317073518.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494878613  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR87861  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aVogan, Norah L.10aExamining the Relationship between Physical Activity and Arterial Stiffness in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.  a83 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 51-01.  aAdvisers: Michael Stickland; Stewart Petersen.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aThis study investigated the relationship between physical activity and arterial stiffness in COPD. Arterial stiffness was evaluated by pulse wave velocity (PWV) in 23 COPD patients and 10 age-matched controls. All subjects were free of sleep apnea, cardiovascular disease, and none were taking vasoactive medications. Lung function and peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak) were also tested. Physical activity during three consecutive days was assessed using an accelerometer and quantified by using step count and time when metabolic rate exceeded 3 METs. Step count and time spent >3 METs correlated (r=-0.56, p<0.001; r=-0.44, p=0.01) respectively with PWV with COPD patients and controls combined. In a stepwise regression, step count was found to predict PWV(r=-0.56, p3 METs and one-second forced expiratory volume (FEV1%pred) did not improve the prediction. The results indicate that physical activity may influence vascular health in COPD, and physical inactivity may partly explain the increased cardiovascular disease risk in COPD.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Recreation.  a057520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-01(E).  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8786102102nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001900129245010000148300001100248500006000259500003400319502005800353520105800411590002301469650002701492690000901519710003601528773004701564790000901611791001001620792000901630793001201639856014901651AAIMR8786220150317073518.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494878620  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR87862  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBarre, Yasmin.10aCharacterization of the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase for N-linked protein glycosylation.  a158 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 51-01.  aAdviser: Christine Szymanski.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aIn Campylobacter jejuni, the oligosaccharyltransferase, Pg1B, transfers a heptasaccharide from a lipid donor to asparagine within the D/E-X-N-X-S/T consensus sequon (X&ne;P) or releases this glycan directly into the periplasm. Using a bioinformatic approach, we identified a conserved DXXK motif within C. jejuni Pg1B and generated point mutants at the D and K sites. We demonstrated that the DXXK motif plays an important structural role for N-glycosylation and free-oligosaccharide (fOS) production. Further downstream of the DXXK sequence, we analyzed the Pg1B enzymes from C. jejuni and C. lari and showed that a single amino acid substitution improved C. lari  Pg1B activity. We also explored the possible autoregulatory mechanism of Pg1B by generating a point mutation within the N-glycosylation consensus sequence within the soluble domain of Pg1B. We demonstrated that the asparagine mutation does not influence protein glycosylation, but shows reduced fOS production, suggesting that Pg1B auto-glycosylation may regulate its hydrolase activity.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Microbiology.  a041020aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-01(E).  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8786202426nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001500129245004500144300001100189500006000200500002800260502005800288520139200346590002301738650002401761650002501785690000901810690000901819710003601828773004701864790000901911791001001920792000901930793001201939856014901951AAIMR8786820150317073519.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494878682  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR87868  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhou, You.10aNMR Assisted Protein Structure Modeling.  a100 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 51-01.  aAdviser: David Wishart.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aTraditional protein structure modeling methods that primarily use sequence information to predict protein structure have two shortcomings: (1) they work poorly on proteins that have no known homologue and (2) they can lead to incorrect models because homologous proteins may not always share analogous structures. In this thesis I will describe a new method that models protein structures using amino acid sequence information as well as a minimal amount of experimental information. By combining amino acid sequence information with relatively minimal experimental data, this new protocol allows the traditional knowledge-based modeling methods to efficiently avoid these shortcomings while retaining their high level of accuracy and efficiency. The experimental data used in this approach includes chemical shifts and sparse backbone Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) restraints. This novel method uses only a very small fraction of the data normally required to solve a structure. When evaluated on 25 recently solved protein structures, this method successfully predicted the structure of 23 proteins with an average RMSD (root mean square deviation) of just about 2.4 A. This method can also be easily modified to predict protein structures using other types of intra-molecular distance restraints, such as disulfide constraints and cross-link distances measured by mass spectrometry.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Molecular. 4aBiophysics, General.  a0307  a078620aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-01(E).  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8786802000nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002200129245008500151300001100236500006000247500002800307502005800335520097700393590002301370650002401393690000901417710003601426773004701462790000901509791001001518792000901528793001201537856014901549AAIMR8787120150317073519.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494878712  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR87871  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aDewar, Jill Anne.10aCharacterization of tra-2(ed23ts) suppressor alleles in Caenorhabditis briggsae.  a104 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 51-01.  aAdviser: David Pilgrim.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aC. elegans, C. species 11, and  C. briggsae all represent species from the genus Caenorhabditis  that have independently evolved hermaphrodite/male modes of reproduction.

I have identified some of these alleles as lesions in fem-2 and fem-3, genes that had been previously identified in C. briggsae. I have also characterized the first alleles of C. briggsae fem-1. Additionally, alleles have been isolated that display phenotypes that have never been seen in C. elegans, suggesting that these alleles represent novel genes within the C. briggsae sex determination pathway.

This project is historically situated within literature of international development and sport for development and peace, and takes into account the context inherent in international volunteering. Using a case study approach, I employ a combination of methods including Fairclough's Critical Discourse Analysis of key policy documents concerning the PAW program, as well as interviews with past student-volunteers. I explore the experiences of past PAW student-volunteers through the cultural theory of Raymond Williams (1977; 1980), which encourages a critique that entertains the complex interplay of social, economic, political and cultural processes that come together to legitimize a social phenomenon like the PAW program. By using PAW as a case to explore experiences of past student-volunteers within sport for development and peace, I am able to comment on the larger climate of international development that has evolved to encourage sport within its repertoire of development strategies, and demonstrate the ways in which these programs have the potential to both make and un-make traditional notions of culture, international relationships, and globalization.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aRecreation.  a081420aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-01(E).  a0351  aM.A.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8787202126nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100003400129245010500163300001100268500006000279500002500339502005700364520107700421590002301498650002301521690000901544710003601553773004701589790000901636791000901645792000901654793001201663856014901675AAIMR8787520150317073519.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494878750  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR87875  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFradkin, Jeremy Aaron Nathan.10aGodliness With a Difference: Religious Arguments for Toleration in Mid-Seventeenth- Century England.  a120 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 51-01.  aAdviser: Andrew Gow.  aThesis (M.A.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aThis thesis explores some of the religious arguments for toleration in Civil War and Interregnum England. The object of study is not 'toleration' as a singular ideal, but rather a selection of proposed 'tolerations' from this period. The thesis argues that these proposals advocated toleration as something beneficial to the true Christian religion. The first chapter explores the role of sceptical arguments in establishing a probabilistic Protestant epistemology which underpinned proposals for toleration in the 1640s. The second chapter examines the 'conscientious' religious methodology that certain tolerationists envisioned when they advocated a Christian religion grounded in Scripture, 'Reason,' industry and sound moral character. The third chapter suggests that 'philo-semitic' English millenarians believed that Jewish difference would be renewed, rather than erased, by Christ in the millennial kingdom. Together, these chapters suggest that certain kinds of religious difference were deemed 'tolerable' because that difference itself was seen as a godly one.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHistory, European.  a033520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-01(E).  a0351  aM.A.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR8787502065nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002500129245007800154300001100232500006000243500002800303502005800331520105400389590002301443650001601466690000901482710003601491773004701527790000901574791001001583792000901593793001201602856014901614AAIMR9143420150317073519.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494914342  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR91434  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSchultz, Ryan James.10aMulti-scale mantle reflectivity imaging using secondary seismic arrivals.  a111 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 51-04.  aAdviser: Yu Jeffrey Gu.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aOn the global scale, seismically observed stratifications in mantle reflectivity have been attributed to mineralogical phase changes of olivine. Analysis of a large set of SS precursors constrains the topography of mantle stratifications beneath parts of the descending Pacific plate along the Honshu and Kuril islands. These findings provide compelling evidence for strong deformations in the stagnant slabs and for lower-mantle penetrating lithosphere. Alternative to SS, P'P' precursors promise to resolve the fine scale structure in the mantle, owing to its short-period nature, shallow angle of incidence and nearly symmetric Fresnel zone. Unfortunately, P'P' precursors are known for several complications: phase triplication and the maximum-phase Fresnel zones result in strong scattering and asymmetric arrivals. This thesis purports a means for resolving fine scale mantle structure with the problematic P'P' phase.

Because the M. caudofemoralis is the primary hindlimb retractor, large M. caudofemoralis masses give new evidence in favor of greater athleticism. The tails of theropods had a dynamic evolution and became specialized for a wide range of additional functions in various lineages. In Ceratosaurus the tail may have been adapted for swimming. In the South American abelisaurs, the angle of the caudal ribs was gradually adjusted to facilitate an even larger M. caudofemoralis that probably increased maximum running performance. In oviraptorosaurs, the tail supported a fan of feathers, and appears to have become modified for courtship displays. In dromaeosaurs, caudal rods may have allowed the tail to serve as an aerial rudder.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Evolution and Development. 4aPaleontology.  a0412  a041820aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg51-05(E).  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR9186402005nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002300129245007500152300001100227500006000238502005700298520099100355590002301346650001101369650002201380690000901402690000901411710003601420773004701456790000901503791000901512792000901521793001201530856014901542AAIMR9630320150317073519.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494963036  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR96303  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aStockford, Janine.10aCeline Dion and Shania Twain: The Globalization of Canada's Pop Divas.  a163 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 52-04.  aThesis (M.A.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aAs Canada's best-selling female pop stars, Celine Dion and Shania Twain have launched internationally successful careers by negotiating the sociocultural boundaries, both real and imagined, between Canada, the United States, and beyond. Their careers represent rich case studies in the phenomenon of global popular music networks. How do they and their marketers and producers "translate" their music so it can be so widely understood and appreciated? My research aims to answer this question by mapping out how Celine and Shania have both embodied certain widely appealing qualities and appropriated a multiplicity of national identities, iconographies, and musical traditions in their work. My consideration of Celine's and Shania's music and personae in the context of the global music industry, international fan communities, and Las Vegas where both perform residency shows sheds light on the mechanisms behind superstardom and poses questions about the very meaning of popularity.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aMusic. 4aCanadian Studies.  a0413  a038520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg52-04(E).  a0351  aM.A.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR9630302115nam a2200337   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100003000129245008200159300001100241500006000252502005800312520098400370590002301354650003201377650004601409650002301455690000901478690000901487690000901496710003601505773004701541790000901588791001001597792000901607793001201616856014901628AAIMR9630420150317073519.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494963043  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR96304  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aStrawson, Cynthia Louise.10aChanging Dietary Patterns of Undergraduate Students with Nutrition Education.  a265 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 52-04.  aThesis (M.Sc.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aThis study describes the dietary patterns of university students with nutrition education and examines dietary changes when the students travel to Italy. Student's diets did not reflect the recommendations of Eating Well with Canada's Food Guide (EWCFG) or the Traditional Healthy Mediterranean Diet Pyramid (THMPD). Participants did not achieve the EAR or AI for most micronutrients. While in Italy, students increased intakes of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (132%), calcium (67%), alcohol from wine (345%) and energy from MUFA, polyunsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates and alcohol. A novel Mediterranean Diet Quality Index Score (MDQIS) was developed to measure adherence to THMDP. Mean MDQIS increased significantly for fish and seafood (p=0.002), wine (p<0.0001) and olive oil (p=0.001) but decreased significantly for sweets (p=0.027), poultry (p=0.001), and red meats (p=0.049). The overall mean MDQIS was low in both Canada (21.9 +/- 3.7) and Italy (22.9 +/- 3.9).  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Nutrition. 4aHealth Sciences, Public Health Education. 4aEducation, Higher.  a0570  a0500  a074520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg52-04(E).  a0351  aM.Sc.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR9630402166nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001800129245010200147300001000249500006000259500002400319502005700343520113200400590002301532650002901555690000901584710003601593773004701629790000901676791000901685792000901694793001201703856014901715AAIMR9640420150317073520.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964040  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR96404  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aNikic, Milan.10aOptimal Selection of Delayed Coke Drum Materials Based on ASME Section II Material Property Data.  a88 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 52-04.  aAdviser: Zihui Xia.  aThesis (M.S.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aA remarkable contribution to the oil refining process has been made by introducing delayed coking process. The delayed coking enabled thermal cracking of heavy oil residue into useful lighter oil products and coke as a useful by-product. The achievement of the delayed coking has been made at the expense of increasing oil processing temperatures. Because the process is cyclic, the high cyclic operating temperatures combined with cyclic mechanical loads significantly reduce the operating life of the delayed coke drums. The objective of this thesis is to assess alternative materials for the delayed coke drum applications based on material property data provided in ASME Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, Section II. The materials were compared based on their metallurgical and mechanical properties and the stress level in the coke drum shell obtained from finite element simulations for two critical operating scenarios, i.e. heating up stage and quenching stage. Among the materials studied, SA-302-C as a base material cladded with the nickel alloy N06625 is a proposed material pair for the delayed coke drum application.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEngineering, Mechanical.  a054820aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg52-04(E).  a0351  aM.S.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR9640402306nam a2200373   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100003400129245010700163300001100270500006000281500002500341502005700366520039100423520043300814520028101247590002301528650003001551650002901581650002401610690000901634690000901643690000901652710003601661773004701697790000901744791000901753792000901762793001201771856014901783AAIMR9640620150317073520.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964064  a(MiAaPQ)AAIMR96406  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCroutze, Roger Charles Frank.10aStructural and molecular characterization of the human meniscus for application in tissue engineering.  a135 p.  aSource: Masters Abstracts International, Volume: 52-04.  aAdviser: Nadr Jomha.  aThesis (M.S.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aMenisci fulfill crucial biomechanical roles within the knee.

We examined the potential of normal (21%) and low (3%) oxygen tension to mitigate phenotypic loss in 3D scaffold culture. Inner and outer MFCs demonstrated equivalent redifferentiation potential toward fibrochondrogenesis and this effect was enhanced by normoxic culture.  aSecond, we examined the distribution of CD34 cell surface marker and predominant ECM components, collagen types I and II.

This study's purpose was to understand the role of social relationships and competence in children's motivation to participate in the disability sport of sledge hockey. Harter's theory of Competence Motivation (1978) was used as this qualitative case study's conceptual framework. Sledge hockey players, one girl and nine boys, ages 11-16 participated. Data were collected through observations, field notes, semi-structured interviews, photographs, reflective notes and document analysis. Four themes emerged: 1) "Cause the coach tells ya'," 2) "They think it's right for me," 3) "I keep playing sledge hockey to keep relationships with them," and 4) "I like how everyone can play it." Interactions and relationships with coaches, parents and peers contributed significantly and mostly positively to the participant's perceptions of competence and motivation to play sledge hockey as did the competitive nature of the sport.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aRecreation. 4aEducation, Physical.  a0814  a052320aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tMasters Abstracts Internationalg52-04(E).  a0351  aM.A.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:MR9640703581nam a2200337   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002600129245009500155300001100250500008900261502005800350520093100408520083201339520069902171590002302870650002602893650003102919690000902950690000902959710003602968773005003004790000903054791001003063792000903073793001203082856014903094AAINR5406020150317073520.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494540602  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR54060  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMair, Kimberly Marie.10aCutting out one's tongue---the Red Army Faction and the aesthetics of body (anti)language.  a287 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 70-12, Section: A, page: 4527.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aDrawing from my archival research on the Red Army Faction (RAF), also known as the Baader-Meinhof Gang, and the urban guerrilla movement active in the Bundesrepublik Deutschland from the 1970s, my dissertation works  through the RAF to speculate about the compulsion towards self-representation inherent to subjectivity. Such compulsion proffers an urgent and recurrent imperative to speak what cannot be said or to conjure what does not exist. This work argues that the perils and the failures of such enunciation, in the face of its compulsory demand, are felt not only in speech but in  choreographies of subjectivity performed in aesthetic convolutions  of space, gesture, and intonation. These convolutions are subject-forming material productions, rather than reflections or echoes of a pre-existing coherent subject, and trouble the notion of self-representation to the extent that they produce and re-produce the self.  aWhile the body is formed by culture, it consistently circumvents the limits of the genres that govern speech communication, therefore, my work is concerned with tracing a mise en scene of self-production  by emphasizing non-textual elements. The forms that this circumvention can take exceed the involuntary cry, gesture, uneven breath, or facial expression to include uses of space---space that is implicated in the body's formation---but the public legibility of such circumventions is not guaranteed. This work aims to refunction the RAF's declaration of the body as a weapon to the body as a medium for communication and to approach the aesthetics of a body (anti)language that extends beyond the particularities of the urban guerrilla project to the situation of mundane subjectivity that repeatedly calls for enunciation.  aMy dissertation is a performative text that deploys formal interventions---such as collage, assemblage, photography, and interleaved texts meant to intrude upon the reader---that target instrumental language use. To illustrate that the ongoing production of subjectivity of the urban guerrilla is not alien to that of the politically recognizable citizen, my work contemplates practices of contemporary art and the production of material objects of signification that of the politically recognizable citizen, my work contemplates practices of contenporary art and the production of material objects of signification that engage in practices of citation and disguise the incoherence of our acts.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aSpeech Communication. 4aSociology, Organizational.  a0459  a070320aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg70-12A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR5406002686nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002800129245008500157300001100242500008900253502005800342520093700400520065201337590002301989650002402012650003102036690000902067690000902076710003602085773005002121790000902171791001002180792000902190793001202199856014902211AAINR5534320150317073520.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494553435  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR55343  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFamulski, Jakub Konrad.10aStructure-function study of the human mitotic checkpoint protein Zeste White 10.  a194 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 71-01, Section: B, page: 9000.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aThe ultimate goal of the cell cycle is to replicate and subsequently segregate the genome into two identical daughter cells. While the replication of our genome occurs during S-phase, the physical segregation of our genetic material occurs during mitosis. Although it is the shortest stage of the cell cycle, mitosis is a highly coordinated and mechanistically sophisticated cellular event. Failure or improper execution of mitosis is catastrophic for individual cells as well as a potential precursor to malignancy. The mis-segregation of even one chromosome can negatively impact cell survival or conversely lead to mis-regulation of cell growth. In fact, many human cancers are associated with elevated levels of aneuploidy that are thought to result from chromosome mis-segregation. Understanding the mechanisms that govern as well as power the mitotic machinery has thus been the focus of research for almost an entire century.  aMy PhD research project has focused on the mitotic function of the human RZZ-dynein/dynactin kinetochore complex through a direct molecular structure-function study of one of its components, Zeste White 10. Using fluorescence as well as live cell microscopy, I have deciphered the mechanism regulating kinetochore residency of the RZZ complex, as well as its role in mitotic checkpoint response to inter-kinetochore tension. My work has reinforced the importance of studying the regulation of mitotic checkpoint component kinetochore dynamics as well as the importance of dynein/dynactin-mediated transport of checkpoint proteins off kinetochores.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Molecular. 4aHealth Sciences, Oncology.  a0307  a099220aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg71-01B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR5534303630nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002700129245015600156300001100312500008900323502005800412520155800470520096402028590002302992650002903015690000903044710003603053773005003089790000903139791001003148792000903158793001203167856014903179AAINR5535020150317073520.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494553503  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR55350  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWaktola Geda, Tsedale.10aGlobalization and neo -liberalization: Challenges and opportunities to enset crop -based agricultural communities and their farming system in Ethiopia.  a201 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 71-01, Section: A, page: 2730.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aNeo-liberal globalization has challenges and opportunities for rural agrarian communities. Creating alternate market outlet is one of the opportunities rendered by neo-liberal globalization. Furthermore, those that afford to buy agricultural inputs have benefited from scientific agricultural and technological innovations. The challenges include distributing to all farming communities the benefits from neo-liberal globalization. In chapter 2, the conceptual definitions of globalization, neo-liberalization, governance and other concepts and relevant literature are presented. The influence of those aforementioned factors on the socio-economic changes in the selected traditional farming communities in Ethiopia has been analyzed. In chapter 3, the influence of neo-liberal globalization on gender roles is examined. In chapter 4, linkages between the three phenomena: traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), culture and globalization and their influence on selected traditional rural farming communities is analyzed. The overall objective of this study is to contribute to the understanding of the current threats to food security in Ethiopia. Ethiopia is selected for this study because the country is unique in being able to provide information on the selected topic. Enset crop is elected because it plays a crucial role in the food security currently estimated for more than 15 million farming communities. A case of Gurage is selected, since Gurage ethnic group is one of the major ethnic groups that depend on enset crop as their staple food.  aA qualitative method that includes observation, semi-structured interviews, document analysis, and field work has been followed. Some of the key findings reveal that: (1) Consensus among policy makers, researchers and agricultural offices heads and agricultural extension workers on the limited contribution of neo-liberal globalization of agriculture to enset crop development; (2) Gender role shift has been observed where a woman takes over the traditional men's role in agricultural production; and (3) recent transitions in enset crop production have been observed in response to globalization. In summary, this study reveals that despite the limited benefits by traditional rural farming communities from neo-liberal globalization of agriculture, there still are various opportunities that can be tapped through partnership among government agricultural offices, non-governmental organizations and farming communities that creates local-global linkages.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEconomics, Agricultural.  a050320aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg71-01A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR5535003041nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100003400129245013200163300001100295500008900306502005800395520195900453590002302412650003202435690000902467710003602476773005002512790000902562791001002571792000902581793001202590856014902602AAINR5559620150317073520.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494555965  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR55596  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMarques Maia do Prado, Carla.10aPrevalence, characteristics and health consequences of abnormal body composition phenotypes in patients with malignant disease.  a171 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 71-01, Section: B, page: 2340.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aAbnormal body composition phenotypes, such as sarcopenia (depletion of muscle mass), obesity (excess adipose tissue) and the combination of the two, sarcopenic obesity, have emerged as important predictors of clinical outcomes in several disease states. However, the prevalence and clinical importance of these phenotypes in patients with malignant diseases has not been well characterized. The overall purpose of this research was to investigate abnormal body composition phenotypes among patients with cancer; and to determine the prevalence, characteristics and health consequences associated with these phenotypes. Body composition was measured using gold-standard methods such as dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and computerized tomography (CT) imaging analysis. This research has shown that, in patients with cancer, body composition is extremely variable. Sarcopenia, obesity and sarcopenic obesity are syndromes of concern for these patients, and these conditions cannot be verified by use of body weight or body mass index (BMI) alone. This research was the first to demonstrate that abnormal body composition phenotypes such as sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity were independently linked to increased prevalence of chemotherapy-related toxicity, poor functional status, shorter time to tumor progression and reduced survival in patients with malignant disease. Moreover, the use of CT analysis was raised as a gold standard method for body composition assessment in patients with cancer. Computerized tomography is almost ubiquitously available in the health records of cancer patients, providing a measure of body composition for potential use to predict clinical outcomes, and individualize chemotherapy dosing. In summary, the wide variability of muscle and adipose tissues among patients with cancer and its association with important clinical outcomes, demonstrates that body composition assessment is a tool for future cancer care.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Nutrition.  a057020aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg71-01B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR5559603337nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001600129245010200145300001100247500008900258502005800347520231900405590002302724650001602747690000902763710003602772773005002808790000902858791001002867792000902877793001202886856014902898AAINR5563020150317073521.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494556306  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR55630  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWang, Xiye.12aA comparison of Canadian and Chinese university students' travel motivations and concept of face.  a183 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 71-01, Section: A, page: 3310.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aTourism has become a strong, competitive, and fast-growing industry in Canada and China, with youth and student travel representing a significant segment of both markets. Unfortunately, relatively few studies have focused on university students' travel generally or their motivations specifically. In addition, culture's effect on students' travel motivations and behaviours remains largely unexplored. Thus, this study examined Canadian and Chinese university students' travel motivations using Driver's Recreation Experience Preference (REP) scales and Iso-Ahola's social psychological model. The researcher also introduced a Chinese concept of face to explain their travel motivations and behaviours. The following five research questions led this study: (1) Are there similarities and differences in Chinese and Canadian university students' travel motivations? (2) Are "escaping" motives more important than "seeking" motives in university students' travel experiences? (3) Do gender, culture, or both affect motivations? (4) Is face concern a more important motive for Chinese university students' travel than Canadians and, if so, how does this process occur? And (5) does gender affect face concern in their travel experience? Through the use of a quantitative survey method, the researcher found that among 295 Canadian and 352 Chinese university students: (1) five of the seven motivations differed significantly between Canadians and Chinese; (2) the importance of the escaping and seeking motives varied by cultural groups; (3) although the interaction between culture and gender was not significant, gender alone was significant for five of the seven motivations; (4) the cultural groups evaluated the three face-concern dimensions (self-, other-, and mutual-face) differently; and (5) only gender had significant influence on mutual-face. These results contribute to a cross-cultural understanding of travel motivations and face and have both theoretical and practical implications. The theoretical implications lie in the scale development and cross-cultural applicability of existing Western theory and frameworks on travel motivations, and the practical implications suggest how tourism providers can attract university students in both cultural groups. Future research directions are recommended.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aRecreation.  a081420aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg71-01A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR5563003396nam a2200337   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100003500129245011500164300001100279500008900290502005800379520018200437520033400619520064700953520077401600520034902374590002302723650002802746690000902774710003602783773005002819790000902869791001002878792000902888793001202897856014902909AAINR5564920150317073521.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494556498  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR55649  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMeza Diaz, Brigida Inmaculada.10aSand on demand:  An approach to improving productivity in horizontal wells under heavy oil primary production.  a308 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 71-01, Section: B, page: 6320.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aThe cold production recovery process, as practised in Western Canada, is successful in vertical wells. Attempts at cold production in horizontal wells have been less successful.  aThis dissertation presents the results of research examining the possibility of controlled sand production, "sand on demand" for horizontal wells. Specifically, the effects of slot size, confining stress, fluid velocity and sand grain sorting on sand production under less aggressive production conditions have been investigated.  aThe results indicate that slot size selection is critical for establishing "sand on demand". For proper slot size selection, it is essential to know the grain size distribution and the sorting (uniformity coefficient) of the sand. The findings from the sand production experiments indicate that the critical pressure gradients required for initiating sand production and for maintaining continuous sand production are much lower for well-sorted sands than for poorly-sorted sands. A correlation between slot size and controlled sand production was found for well-sorted sands that should allow for the specification of appropriate slot sizes.  aThe critical pressure gradient required for initiating sand production and maintaining continuous sand production decreases as the slot width or confining pressure increases. When flow rates resulted in persistent sand production, channels and/or elliptical dilated zones were created that greatly enhanced the effective permeability near the slot. This observation suggests that producing at low and steady sand cuts for a long period of time might bring two benefits; a way to transport the sand out of the well and the creation of high permeability channels or zones that can improve the production of the reservoir. Continuing sand production at sand cuts less than 1.5 % was achieved if the initial flow rates were low and were later increased in small increments.  aTo summarize, it was found that if the appropriate slot size was combined with the right draw down rates, controlled sand production could be achieved with attendant significant increases in permeability. This suggests that radically increased oil rates could be achieved if sand production rates can be maintained at low and consistent levels.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEngineering, Petroleum.  a076520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg71-01B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR5564903552nam a2200385   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002800129245008500157300001100242500008900253502005800342520230500400590002302705650002602728650001502754650002102769650002902790650002702819690000902846690000902855690000902864690000902873690000902882710003602891773005002927790000902977791001002986792000902996793001203005856014903017AAINR5580520150317073521.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494558058  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR55805  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBradford, Justin Tolly.10aRemaking indigenaity: Indigenous missionaries in the British Empire, 1820--1875.  a291 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 71-01, Section: A, page: 2140.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aIn the 1840s, Christian mission organizations from Britain began establishing self-governing, independent indigenous churches staffed by ordained indigenous missionaries. By the 1860s, this initiative had created a world-wide cohort of ordained indigenous missionaries with close ties to Britain and Christianity. This dissertation compares two of these early indigenous missionaries, Henry Budd a Cree from western Canada (1812-1875) and Tiyo Soga a Xhosa from southern Africa (1829-1871). It argues that while Budd and Soga were part of the same process of modernizing indigenaity, their local frontier and particular missionary network led them to create different definitions of indigenaity and distinct kinds of indigenous communities. The thesis begins by explaining how both men were guided by their family and sense of "home" to become missionaries and how both articulated, through their writings and actions, a similar sense of "modern indigenaity." This modern indigenaity comprised of two parts: a new identity that located the meaning of indigenaity not in religion or lifestyle, but in land, language and history; and a new sense of global consciousness that enabled the missionaries to see connections between their lives and the lives of people around the world. The second section of the thesis examines how Budd and Soga, acting as advisors to and advocates for indigenous people, tried to establish new---but very distinct---kinds of indigenous communities in their respective regions. Budd, drawing on the Cree band structure and fluid fur-trade frontier, hoped to establish a "Cree village community" that was Christian, semi-agrarian and bound together by the Cree language. Soga, relying on the hierarchal tribal structure of the Xhosa and nearly a century of race-based warfare between whites and Africans in his region, fostered a "Xhosa national community" that was larger and more robust than Budd's village and bound by race and history as well as language. These different communities reveal that while Budd transformed Creeness into a predominantly linguistic and territorial category of identity, Soga made Xhosaness into a political identity. These remade community identities, and their connection to British Christianity, are the legacies of indigenous missionaries.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aReligion, History of. 4aBiography. 4aHistory, Modern. 4aNative American Studies. 4aSouth African Studies.  a0320  a0304  a0582  a0740  a065420aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg71-01A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR5580503845nam a2200349   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001600129245008200145300001100227500008900238502005800327520054300385520077800928520051201706520031702218520034402535520028202879590002303161650002703184690000903211710003603220773005003256790000903306791001003315792000903325793001203334856014903346AAINR5583820150317073521.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494558386  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR55838  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aZhou, Ting.10aApplication of metal oxide columns in high performance liquid chromatography.  a148 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 71-01, Section: B, page: 2880.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aOver the past fifty years high performance liquid chromatography has become one of the most important analytical techniques for determination of compounds. The vast majority of HPLC columns are based on porous silica. However, silica HPLC columns can only be used within a limited (typically 2-8) pH range. Polymeric columns do not suffer from these pH limitations, but are susceptible to swelling or shrinkage in the presence of organic solvent. Also small molecules undergo poor mass transfer within the micropores in polymer particles.  aThis thesis explores the use of metal oxide columns (zirconia and titania) to separate hydrophilic compounds. Zirconia and titania have a much stronger pH and mechanical stability. Moreover, because of the Lewis acid sites, they have a strong affinity with Lewis bases such as organophosphates and carboxylates. Herein chemical warfare agent degradation products (organophosphates) are separated on a series of RPLC and IC columns after preconcentration on a bare zirconia column by ligand exchange. Detection limits after preconcentration of a 10-mL sample were 0.16, 0.19 and 0.16 mug/L for MPA, EPA, and PPA, respectively. The recoveries for MPA, EPA and PPA were quantitative for spiked river water samples, demonstrating the robustness of this preconcentration method.  aTo simplify the system, instead of preconcentration, nucleotides are directly separated on a bare titania column. Fifteen nucleotides and their intermediates were separated in 26 min (Rminimum>1.3) using a one-step gradient. A unique retention mode, hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) was found to be dominant on titania with high %ACN in the mobile phase. Addition of phosphate to the eluent suppresses the ligand-exchange interactions with the titania surface such that HILIC may be performed.  aThe HILIC mechanism on titania is further studied by using carboxylates as the model analytes. Electrostatic repulsion, ligand exchange and hydrophilic interaction all affect retention on titania. A series of guidelines for separations on titania are developed and then applied to the separation of carboxylates.  aThe possibility of gradient separations on titania under HILIC conditions is also discussed. The re-equilibration time on titania is measured at different eluent conditions and column temperatures. Regardless of conditions, the column re-equilibration was slow---an observation that may have significance for the field of HILIC in general.  aFinally a new type of HILIC column, a Dionex AS9-SC latex coated silica monolith, is introduced. Separations of a variety of hydrophilic compounds were achieved under HILIC conditions. The efficiency is much higher than the commercial Styros AminoHILIC polymer monolith column.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aChemistry, Analytical.  a048620aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg71-01B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR5583803544nam a2200397   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002200129245006700151300001100218500008900229502005800318520101500376520128801391590002302679650004902702650000902751650002202760650002302782650002102805690000902826690000902835690000902844690000902853690000902862710003602871773005002907790000902957791001002966792000902976793001202985856014902997AAINR7119720150317073521.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494711972  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR71197  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aRazavy, Maryam F.10aFaith-Based Arbitration in Canada: The Ontario Sharia Debates.  a332 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72-05, Section: A, page: 1797.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aFor years, particular Jewish and Christian groups in Ontario had had the option of opting out of the secular court system with respect to uncomplicated cases of divorce, child custody, and inheritance rights (among other things), instead allowing clerical courts to settle the matters (according to the tenets of their respective religious laws) with decisions that the province recognized as binding. In October of 2003, members of a group called the Islamic Institute of Justice (IICJ) publicly announced that they intended to open a business that would offer Muslims in Canada arbitration of family law matters. The announcement immediately drew fierce opposition both from within the Muslim community and from non-Muslim Canadians alike, quickly thrusting the little known worlds of faith-based arbitration and Sharia law front and center of Canadian public debates. This issue clearly represents one of the most dramatic clashes between religion and state to have occurred in this country in recent years.  aThrough several key areas of discussion, this dissertation broadly explores this interplay between religious rights and individual civil rights (principally those aimed at gender equality), particularly as they relate to processes of legal pluralism, brought about in part by forces of globalization. Regarding the issue of Sharia arbitration courts, this project argues two key points. First, it argues that Canada, through its various policies and laws, has created a template that enables Islamic Sharia courts to exist. Second, it argues that, despite the controversial nature of Islamic law, the Ontario government fell short regarding its responsibility to take a balanced approach on competing rights between religious freedom and legal justice in banning faith-based arbitration. In an effort to protect women's rights, the Ontario government's ban on all faith-based arbitration essentially ignores its continued, unregulated operation and disregards the significant weight that its decisions carry within segments of the Canadian Muslim community. A third alternative would introduce limited Islamic legal discourse into the Canadian legal framework (under a revised Arbitration Act), resulting in a more formalized, reformed, and transparent system of Canadian Sharia law.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aSociology, Social Structure and Development. 4aLaw. 4aCanadian Studies. 4aReligion, General. 4aIslamic Studies.  a0700  a0398  a0385  a0318  a051220aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-05A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR7119703461nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002600129245012600155300001100281500008900292502005800381520024300439520100100682520070301683520040602386590002302792650003602815690000902851710003602860773005002896790000902946791001002955792000902965793001202974856014902986AAINR7120320150317073521.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712030  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR71203  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aOreopoulos, Antigone.10aExploring the Associations Between the Obesity Paradox, Body Composition and Prognostic Factors in Chronic Heart Failure.  a165 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72-05, Section: B, page: 2735.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aPrevious studies in chronic heart failure (CHF) have demonstrated an 'obesity paradox', whereby higher body mass index (BMI) is associated with improved survival. The reasons behind these paradoxical observations, however, remain unclear.  aThe objective of this program of research was to examine the associations between body composition [measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)] and prognostic factors for mortality (nutritional status, exercise capacity, quality of life, neuroendocrine profile, inflammation) in CHF. This objective was achieved through across-sectional study of 140 ambulatory patients with CHF. The first study explored the associations between body composition (lean body mass and percent body fat) as. BMI and CHF prognostic factors. The objective of the second study was to determine the relationship between different anthropometric indices of adiposity (BMI, waist circumference, waist-stature-ratio and waist index) and DEXA-ascertained body composition, and assess the ability of these indices to measure obesity. The third study looked at the validity of two field measures (bioelectrical impedance analysis and near infrared interactance (NIR)) for assessing body composition compared to DEXA.  aWe found that: 1. Increasing body fat was associated with unfavorable changes and increasing lean body mass was associated with favorable changes in prognostic factors. 2. Directly measured body composition was more closely linked to indicators of prognosis in patients with CHF compared to BMI. 3. Using BMI as the measure of body fat status lead to 41% misclassification of obesity. BMI was similarly (in men) or more highly (in women) correlated with lean body mass than body fat. 4. None of the anthropometric indices tested were acceptably accurate measures of adiposity. 5. NIR had reasonable accuracy for measurement of body composition, however precision of this method is lower than ideal.  aThese findings suggest that BMI has limitations as a surrogate measure of adiposity in patients with CHF and we suspect that this may partly, but not entirely, explain the obesity paradox. Therefore, direct measurement of body composition instead of using BMI is desirable in future studies examining the obesity paradox in CHF. This is ideally performed using DEXA; in its absence, NIR is acceptable.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Public Health.  a057320aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-05B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR7120303758nam a2200361   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001200129245013500141300001100276500008900287502005800376520053800434520070200972520089701674520020602571520024802777590002303025650002703048650002803075690000903103690000903112710003603121773005003157790000903207791001003216792000903226793001203235856014903247AAINR7121520150317073521.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712153  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR71215  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aYu, Yi.10aMechanisms mediating the effects of three goldfish brain somatostatins on somatotropes growth hormone release and gene expression.  a312 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72-05, Section: B, page: 2609.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aGoldfish somatotropes functions are potentially regulated by three hypothalamic somatostatins (SSs), SS-14, goldfish brain (gb)SS-28 and [Pro2]SS-14. This thesis examined the hypothesis that these three SSs modulate growth hormone (GH) release and synthesis by targeting different membrane electrophysiological and intracellular signalling events using dispersed goldfish pituitary cells in Ca2+-imaging, perifusion GH release, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and whole-cell and amphotericin B-perforated patch-clamp studies.  aGoldfish somatotropes did not fire action potentials (APs) spontaneously, but Na+, and L- and N-type- voltage-sensitive Ca2+channels (VSCCs) mediated the depolarization phase of induced AP while delayed rectifier-like K+ currents (IKv) underlay the repolarization phase and regulated excitability. Opening of VSCCs during APs increased intracellular Ca2+levels ([Ca2+]i). The three SSs did not affect Na+ currents but all activated IKv. SS-14 and gbSS-28, but not [Pro2]SS14, reduced VSCC currents. Reduction of Ca2+ entry resulting from direct actions on VSCC and/or indirect effects through IKv enhancement may partly explain the abilities of these SSs to decrease basal GH release and [Ca2+] i.  agbSS-28 attenuated [Ca2+]i and GH responses induced by two gonadotropin-releasing hormones (sGnRH and cGnRH-II) in part by inhibiting protein kinase C-mediated [Ca2+]i signals. gbSS-28 reduced pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-elicited [Ca2+]i and GH responses in a cyclic (c)AMP-independent manner. gbSS-28 decreased dopamine (DA) D1-stimulated cAMP production, but not DA D1-induced [Ca2+]i and GH responses. Since DA utilized NO signalling and gbSS-28 targeted steps distal to NO production to reduce [Ca2+]i and GH release, the ability of DA to bypass gbSS-I4 inhibition might be manifested through mobilization of intracellular Ca2+. Manipulation of [Ca2+] i was an important site for regulation of GH release by gbSS-28, but results with depolarizing concentrations of KCl indicated that [Ca2+]i increases and exocytosis were dissociated during acute gbSS-28 treatment.  aAll three SSs reduced cGnRH-II-stimulated GH mRNA expression, but sGnRH effects were only reduced by SS-14. Basal GH mRNA expression was unaffected by SS-I4 and gbSS-28 but was elevated by [Pro2]SS-I4.  aThese data indicate that SS isoforms can differentially regulate GH release and gene expression by targeting select sites along several signalling pathways involved in the regulation of goldfish somatotropes by multiple neuroendocrine factors.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Neuroscience. 4aBiology, Endocrinology.  a0317  a040920aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-05B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR7121503053nam a2200337   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002300129245008600152300001100238500008900249502005800338520191100396590002302307650003202330650001902362650003202381690000902413690000902422690000902431710003602440773005002476790000902526791001002535792000902545793001202554856014902566AAINR7121920150317073521.5150317s2009    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712191  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR71219  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aElmi, Afyare Abdi.10aPossibilities for Peacebuilding: Challenges and Responses to the Somali Conflict.  a227 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72-05, Section: A, page: 1766.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2009.  aSeventeen years have passed since the Somali state collapsed in 1991. Yet, although the international community, employing liberal approaches to peacebuilding, has made repeated attempts to end the civil war, all of the externally imposd solutions failed to establish neither durable peace nor a functioning state in Somalia. In 2006, heterogeneous local Islamist movements under the banner of the Union of Islamic Courts defeated Somali warlords and restored peace in Mogadishu and most of southern Somalia, thus surprising observers and the international community. Using a combination of post-colonialism and social constructivist paradigms and interviews and document analysis methodologies, this dissertation critically examines how some of the often excluded stakeholders such as Islamists, members from the business community, and nationalist intellectuals understand the challenges of and responses to building peace in Somalia. In-depth analysis of interviews, secondary documents, and observations reveal that there are four major challenges: two domestic and two external. The research finds that the divisive nature of clan identity and presence of a strong Islamist movement that attracts unwanted external meddling are the two major domestic challenges while American policy (actions or inactions) toward Somalia and Ethiopia's hostile meddling are the external factors that undermine previous peacebuilding efforts in Somalia. Moreover, the study identifies governance and education as the two long-term responses to the Somali conflict. The findings of this study are relevant for policymakers and peacemakers who are trying to establish durable peace in Somalia. Finally, contrary to the prevailing approach that focuses on clans, it is argued that traditionally ignored stakeholders (e.g., business leaders, Islamists, and intellectuals) are key to both theory building and peacebuilding.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aPolitical Science, General. 4aPeace Studies. 4aSub Saharan Africa Studies.  a0615  a0563  a063920aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-05A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2009  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR7121903200nam a2200385   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002400129245009700153300001100250500008900261502005800350520038400408520075900792520081701551590002302368650002902391650002902420650003302449650002102482690000902503690000902512690000902521690000902530710003602539773005002575790000902625791001002634792000902644793001202653856014902665AAINR7122620150317073521.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712269  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR71226  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBruno, Shauna Lynn.10aNehiyawiskwew Acimowina: Attending to the Silences in the Lives of Cree Women in University.  a218 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72-05, Section: A, page: 1610.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aNehiyawiskwew Acimowina; Cree Women's stories is about the lived experiences of women studying in universities, particularly women who are graduates of Aboriginal- focused teacher education programs in Western Canada. These stories unfold the tensions in the complex lives lived by four women as they pursued their university degrees with a focus on Aboriginal teacher education.  aThe purpose of the study was to explore the stories the women live by and how these are shaped. My research asked, "How do personal, professional, and spiritual relationships inform the experiences of Cree women in university?" This work identifies stories silenced in the university context and reveals the disturbing truth that our stories have little or no place in these institutions. The unfolding realities of silences emerged. This study attends to these silences in the descriptions of university and teaching experiences. A shift in my thinking was required in order for the knowledge hidden in the silence to emerge and for me to understand the meaning in the stories. I had to find and come from a place of listening within a cultural context.  aThe stories bring significant insight into the Nehiyawak value system and how these values are lived out in personal and professional lives in community and in the classroom. The ethics of relationships and community are an embodiment of knowledge that reflects Nehiyawak values. Cree knowledge is a way of living. It is embodied in who we are as Cree people. For many who continue on to university there is no comfortable place for this way of living in a university environment. Attending to the silences requires us to attend to the way the women lived their personal and professional lives according to their own Indigenous experience. We can learn through attending to the silence shared and lived out in storied lives. Being true to our own knowledge systems can help us make sense of our life experiences.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEducation, Sociology of. 4aNative American Studies. 4aEducation, Teacher Training. 4aWomen's Studies.  a0340  a0740  a0530  a045320aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-05A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR7122603013nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002100129245005600150300001100206500008900217502005800306520056700364520062600931520081601557590002302373650001902396690000902415710003602424773005002460790000902510791001002519792000902529793001202538856014902550AAINR7122920150317073521.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712290  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR71229  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aShin, Seung Woo.10aExcavation disturbed zone in Lac du Bonnet granite.  a224 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72-05, Section: B, page: 3067.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aThe excavations of underground openings alter the mechanical, hydraulic, and geological properties of the rock surrounding openings. The processes that create these alterations, generally referred to as the Excavation Disturbed/Damaged Zone (EDZ) are a functions of rock type, stress-strain response, in-situ stress, shape and dimensions of openings, and the excavation method. Even for openings with the same shapes and dimensions, the properties of the EDZ strongly depend on the geological conditions. Quantifying these properties is particularly challenging.  aIn this study, a discrete element model was used to assess the extent and characteristics of the EDZ around a tunnel in massive Lac du Bonnet granite. Randomly-sized polygonal blocks were created by a Voronoi tessellation scheme implemented in the discrete element code to simulate the brittle behaviour of heterogeneous intact rock. The mechanical properties of the blocks and their contacts in the discrete element model were calibrated using sensitivity studies on conventional laboratory tests on the Lac du Bonnet granite, including uniaxial and triaxial compression tests, Brazilian tests, and direct tension tests.  aThe extent of the EDZ around the tunnel varied spatially. The discrete element modelling methodology showed that the EDZ was characterized by a distribution of cracks. Within the maximum compressive region, the crack distribution was sufficient to create a region with a low deformation modulus. Within the unloaded region in the sidewalls the tensile cracks were constrained in a small region. Effects on tunnel geometry, back-fill pressure, and the temperature increment surrounding the tunnel also were examined. Two failure models were evaluated in the study: (1) a conventional Coulomb slip model with residual strength, and (2) a cohesion loss-friction mobilization model. The results from the various models used in this study were compared to the in situ measurements with seismic velocities and events.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aGeotechnology.  a042820aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-05B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR7122901992nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002500129245003600154300001000190500008900200502005800289520085100347520016801198590002301366650001701389690000901406710003601415773005001451790000901501791001001510792000901520793001201529856014901541AAINR7123420150317073522.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494712344  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR71234  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aPowell, Elizabeth A.10aR-universal central extensions.  a93 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 72-05, Section: B, page: 2819.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aIn this thesis we study universal central extensions of groups and universal central extensions of modules over a group ring. Such group extensions have a century old history and their module analogues have recently enjoyed increasing attention. We carry forward the theories of universal central extensions in the following ways: (i) Given a solid ring R, by restricting to R-module kernels, we generalize both concepts to produce theories of R-universal central extensions of groups and of modules. (ii) We unify the two theories by use of a natural construction that provides a direct translation of properties of module extensions to properties of group extensions. Though this construction appears in the literature, its use in this setting appears to have gone unnoticed. If so, our work also fills a gap in classical mainstream literature.  aEmploying our generalized theories we achieve a partial description of the effect of certain homological plus constructions on the homotopy groups of a CW-complex.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aMathematics.  a040520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg72-05B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR7123402536nam a2200289   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001800129245008500147300001100232500008900243502005800332520150900390590002301899650004001922690000901962710003601971773005002007790000902057791001002066792000902076793001202085856014902097AAINR8095020150317073522.5150317s2010    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494809501  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR80950  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWang, Luming.10aRethinking the Definition and Hybrid Measurement of Consumer-Based Brand Equity.  a159 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-02, Section: A, page: 6910.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2010.  aExisting consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) scales were developed to differentiate between consumers. I propose a new and comprehensive CBBE scale that can be adapted for multiple purposes (e.g., scaling brands or scaling consumers). It recognizes that CBBE is a multi-dimensional construct (e.g., brand awareness, perceived quality, brand emotions) with multiple facets of variation (i.e., brands, consumers, items). Conceptually, the latent construct (CBBE) is distinguished from its dimensions, which are identified as formative or reflective in a hybrid measurement model (of their causal relationship with it). The formative dimensions provide information about sources of CBBE; the reflective dimensions offer parsimonious measurement of CBBE. I collected CBBE data for soft drink and car brands (and subbrands) crossed with respondents. I first, use Multivariate Generalizability Theory (MGT) to assess the performance of the proposed scale when adapted for different managerial needs. Then I use Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to examine the structure of the proposed framework at the consumer level. Finally, I apply Multi-facet Item Response Theory (MFIRT) to estimate brand level equity, independent of the particular dimensions, items and individuals involved in the evaluations. All theories are applied also in a brand portfolio context. The results support the proposed conceptual structure for the measurement of CBBE and provide insights to serve a variety of brand managerial needs.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBusiness Administration, Marketing.  a033820aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-02A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2010  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8095003888nam a2200409   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001900129245013100148300001100279500008900290500005300379502005800432520061200490520042701102520038601529520112301915590002303038650001403061650004203075650002703117650002303144690000903167690000903176690000903185690000903194710003603203773005003239790000903289791001003298792000903308793001203317856014903329AAINR8095420150317073522.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494809549  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR80954  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLesiv, Mariya.10aModern Paganism between East and West: Construction of an alternative national identity in Ukraine and the Ukrainian diaspora.  a339 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-02, Section: A, page: 7270.  aAdvisers: Andriy Nahachewsky; Natalie Kononenko.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aModern Ukrainian Paganism is a new religious movement that draws upon beliefs and practices from over a thousand years ago. It represents a mode of resistance to both the political oppression of Ukraine and the dominant position of Christianity in that country. Paganism spread among the urban Ukrainian intelligentsia in the North American diaspora after World War II, and developed actively in Ukraine after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today, while experiencing a great decline in the diaspora, it is rapidly growing in Ukraine, involving many different Pagan communities and thousands of believers.  aPagans draw on a variety of sources including both historical chronicles containing information about old Slavic mythology and contemporary rural folklore that is believed to maintain remnants of the old pagan worldview. Although many folkloric forms have been appropriated by the Christian church, contemporary Pagans consider these elements to have originated in pre-Christian times and reclaim them for their own needs.  aThis work is the first extended study of Ukrainian Paganism in its post-Soviet East European context and in the North American diaspora, simultaneously comparing it with Western Paganism. It is based on ethnographic fieldwork, including participant observation of rituals and interviews with Pagans in both Ukraine and North America, as well as on archival and published materials.  aWhile focusing predominantly on the revival of pagan folklore within this movement, this thesis demonstrates how the imagined past has become important for constructing an alternative national identity in modern contexts of socio-political turmoil. The thesis suggests that this cultural revival often has little to do with historical reality, since there is limited primary information available. Like other revivals, it involves the construction of new cultural forms through creative interpretations of the ancestral past. Moreover, the obscurity of the past allows individualistic interpretations that result in many variations of similar forms. These forms are examined in their relationship to the concepts of nationalism, gender, charisma and power, religious syncretism, and aesthetics. This work is multidisciplinary in nature as it draws upon theoretical frameworks developed in fields of folkloristics, anthropology, sociology, cultural studies and art criticism. It contributes to the understanding of modern cultural processes that shape the national consciousness of people in various parts of the world.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aFolklore. 4aSociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies. 4aEast European Studies. 4aReligion, General.  a0358  a0631  a0437  a031820aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-02A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8095402644nam a2200361   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002300129245009800152300001100250500008900261502005800350520060700408520071801015520015601733590002301889650002101912650002301933650002401956690000901980690000901989690000901998710003602007773005002043790000902093791001002102792000902112793001202121856014902133AAINR8096320150317073522.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494809631  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR80963  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLebiedowski, Lech.10aCoal and Canvas: The Social and Technological Origins of the Steamship Era, circa 1700--1838.  a356 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-02, Section: A, page: 7320.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aThis thesis presented a detailed examination of steam-powered vessels development before 1838 by utilizing the thick description of technological growth as promoted by recent trends in social constructivism, thus filling a considerable gap in historical enquiry about the subject. It has been demonstrated that the development of early steam-powered vessels was a very prolonged and regional process that commenced in England during the 1600s with the publications of French physicist Denis Papin and culminated in the early 1800s with the formation of a new technological system along the River Clyde.  aThe process of establishing a new technological system in the realm of steam navigation was characterized by the slow evolution of social ideas and technical components rather than a sharp and rapid revolution. As has been shown this system was initiated by work of Patrick Miller, William Symington and Lord Dundas. They created more than a mechanical device, they established financial connections, and financial expectations. They created the beginnings of a production network for steam engines and purpose-built vessels, and pioneered the creation of a new technological system that was to produce three vital innovations in water transport --- the steamboat, the steamship and the transatlantic ocean liner.  aThis thesis addressed one of the fundamental questions in the history of technology, namely, how does a new technology supplant an existing technology?  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHistory, Modern. 4aHistory, European. 4aHistory of Science.  a0582  a0335  a058520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-02A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8096303472nam a2200373   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002300129245009800152300001100250500008900261500002400350502005800374520075800432520118001190520032902370590002302699650002502722650002302747650002602770690000902796690000902805690000902814710003602823773005002859790000902909791001002918792000902928793001202937856014902949AAINR8096520150317073522.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494809655  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR80965  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aJames, Anne Marie.10aReading, Writing, Remembering: Gunpowder Plot Literature in Early Modern England, 1605--1688.  a474 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-02, Section: A, page: 6220.  aAdviser: David Gay.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aIf, as New Historicism posits, literary texts are shaped by their historical contexts, then what is the relationship between religio-political events and literary history? Selecting the 1605 Gunpowder Plot as a case study, I begin by examining the genres---sermons, liturgies, and prose narratives---in which the Jacobean government represented this event, creating a myth of deliverance that would both establish James I as Elizabeth's rightful successor and distinguish him as the founder of a restored Great Britain. Engaging methodologies including reception studies, memory theory, and the history of the public sphere, subsequent chapters examine responses to this narrative by poets, preachers, and dramatists during the remainder of the century.  aIn Chapter Three I argue that the translation and publication of Anglo-Latin Gunpowder poems by Francis Herring and Phineas Fletcher began transforming English epic into a radically Protestant and middle-class genre, with John Milton's In Quintum Novembris representing a crucial step in this process. The next chapter focuses on anniversary sermons by John Donne (1622), Henry Burton (1636), Matthew Newcomen (1642), and Seth Ward (1661), demonstrating how these annual sermons, both as pulpit performances and printed texts, taught listeners and readers the skills necessary to participate in a wider range of religious and political discourse. Finally, turning to the complexities of stage representation, I trace the ways in which three early plays---John Day's Isle of Gulls, Ben Jonson's  Volpone, and Thomas Dekker's Whore of Babylon---engage with each other and with questions raised by the staging of the plotters' trials in early 1606. An examination of Jonson's later Catiline, his conspiracy concludes that the play's probing of the contested relationship between religion and ambition reappeared in a series of ghost poems at the time of the alleged Popish Plot.  aBy reading both generically over time and across genres, I demonstrate that the Gunpowder Plot helped both to create new kinds and to reorient existing ones, suggesting that we need to study further how not only individual texts but also literary history may be shaped by political events and their official representations.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aLiterature, English. 4aHistory, European. 4aReligion, History of.  a0593  a0335  a032020aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-02A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8096503468nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002700129245009200156300001100248500008900259500003200348502005800380520239000438590002302828650003102851690000902882710003602891773005002927790000902977791001002986792000902996793001203005856014903017AAINR8125320150317073522.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494812532  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR81253  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aMartin, Lorri Darlene.10aNuclear positioning of translocation-prone gene loci in patients with multiple myeloma.  a185 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-03, Section: B, page: 1496.  aAdviser: Linda M. Pilarski.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aAccumulating evidence suggests that the non-random nature of spatial genome organization contributes to the formation of chromosomal translocations; specifically, that spatial proximity of potential translocation partners influences translocation potential. Purified subpopulations of non-malignant cells from affected patients have not been studied, or compared to sorted subsets from healthy donors (HD). Proximity of loci in patient-derived normal cells may closely reflect loci positioning for the original cell in which the translocation initially formed, and may favour translocations between proximal loci in a patient-specific manner. In multiple myeloma (MM), recurrent translocations in plasma cells (PC) involve IGH and  FGFR3 t(4;14) or CCND1 t(11;14), or less frequently  c-MAF t(14;16). Utilizing 3-D FISH and 3-D analysis techniques, we analyzed the radial and relative positioning of translocation-prone and control loci in the nuclei of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPC) and B-cells from patients with MM and from HD. The radial and relative positioning was not different among HD HPC, HD B-cells, and HPC from MM patients. On average, in all subsets, IGH, FGFR3, and CCND1 are centrally located in the nucleus, while c-MAF occupies a more peripheral position. In non-malignant B-cells from t(4;14) and t(11;14) patients, IGH and FGFR3, or IGH  and CCND1 are preferentially positioned in spatial proximity: IGH and c-MAF are not. This pattern of positioning differs in B-cells from t(14;16) patients or HD: IGH  is equivalently distal to FGFR3, CCND1, c-MAF, and the control locus, TGFBR2. Our results suggest that spatial proximity and radial position in the nucleus influence translocation potential of specific loci, and are specific to some patient subsets. Furthermore,  FGFR3, and CCND1 frequently position outside their respective chromosome territories (CTs), but c-MAF rarely does. The frequency of extra-territorial positioning (ETP) reflects the clinical frequencies in MM and suggests that ETP may influence translocation potential. Furthermore, extra-territorial FGFR3, and CCND1 occasionally co-localize with IGH. The finding that some translocation-prone gene loci (TPGL) frequently extend beyond their CTs, provides evidence for a previously undocumented mechanism that brings TPGL from different chromosomes into spatial proximity with one another.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Oncology.  a099220aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-03B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8125302755nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100003400129245010600163300001100269500008900280500003600369502005800405520166400463590002302127650001902150690000902169710003602178773005002214790000902264791001002273792000902283793001202292856014902304AAINR8125820150317073522.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494812587  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR81258  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBarber, Megan Rani Winnifred.10aAntiviral pattern recognition receptors in the natural host of influenza, ducks (Anas platyrhynchos).  a166 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-03, Section: B, page: 1344.  aAdviser: Katharine Edens Magor.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aAll strains of influenza replicate in the duck, the natural host of the virus. Ducks suffer little pathology from most influenza viruses, while the same strains are often fatal to chickens. The reasons why ducks and chickens have differing susceptibilities to influenza are not known. We speculated that innate immune mechanisms are particularly important for influenza defense to highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in ducks, due to the acute nature of this infection. We identified and characterized the known influenza detectors, toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) and retinoic-acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) in ducks, to examine their early innate immune response to influenza. A comparison to chickens showed that ducks have a similar genomic organization of TLR7. However, the function of TLR7 differs between ducks and chickens. Ducks, but not chickens, express TLR7 in the lung and always induce IFNalpha upon TLR7 triggering. Ducks have a functional RIG-I, while the gene appears to have been lost in chickens, affording them superior antiviral pattern recognition. Transferring duck RIG-I to chicken cells allows for recognition of RIG-I ligand, decreases low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) and HPAI virus titre, and induces antiviral gene transcription. Thus, differences in the expression, function and even the repertoire of influenza-detecting pattern recognition receptors may all contribute to the relative resistance of ducks and susceptibility of chickens to influenza pathology. Understanding the immunological mechanisms mediating influenza resistance in ducks may provide insight into what constitutes a successful response to this virus.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Cell.  a037920aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-03B.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8125803791nam a2200397   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002600129245011200155300001100267500008900278500002500367502005800392520243700450590002302887650004202910650003602952650003502988650002203023650002803045690000903073690000903082690000903091690000903100690000903109710003603118773005003154790000903204791001003213792000903223793001203232856014903244AAINR8126020150317073522.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494812600  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR81260  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aKhalema, Ernest Nene.10a"Race Talk" in Epidemiology & Public Health: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Canadian and Brazilian Texts.  a451 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-03, Section: A, page: 1184.  aAdviser: Sara Dorow.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aThis dissertation advances the debate on circulating discourses of "race" in epidemiology and public health in Canada and Brazil. Specifically the dissertation elucidates the limitations of epidemiological discourses on "race" that emphasizes "race" as an explanatory variable that explains health disparities and inequalities. Drawing on the method of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this dissertation argues that epidemiological knowledge about "race" and health disparities is a Foucauldian discursive formation with its own particular objects of knowledge and producers of discursivity. The CDA inquiry begins with a critical review of literature on the "scientific" reification of "race" in social science and how this production impacted the field of epidemiology and public health. Then, an analysis of quantitative epidemiological discourse derived from six national surveys in Canada and Brazil data were analyzed to elucidate the limitations of quantitative epidemiological discourse on "race". Further, a historical review of the practice of census enumeration as well as systematic review of articles in the knowledge mobilization process in the academe indicates a normalizing discourse in which "race" is constructed in particular ways for specific purposes, pointing to the legitimation, regurgitation, and recycling of a discourse in the research process. The findings of this dissertation show that codified concepts and an implied logic are utilized in constructing epidemiologic surveys, conveying messages that appear unproblematic. The discourse is further facilitated by epidemiologic analyses in the academe that reify the notion of "race" and legitimize its everyday use as a valid concept. The continued uncritical use of "race" not only reproduces research hegemony, but has policy and practice implications at local, national, and global levels. The dissertation highlights the importance of a qualitative narrative approach in which, contextuality and complexity of qualitative fieldwork in general, and of the narrative approach in particular, dissects categories of difference into comprehensive narrative items. The complexity comes in the articulation of the type of identity questions asked, method of data collection, the definitions of categories (not) offered, the perceived degree of group integration and assimilation, and the socio-historical and political context in which research occurs.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aSociology, Ethnic and Racial Studies. 4aHealth Sciences, Public Health. 4aHealth Sciences, Epidemiology. 4aCanadian Studies. 4aLatin American Studies.  a0631  a0573  a0766  a0385  a055020aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-03A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8126003803nam a2200361   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002500129245013000154300001100284500008900295500002500384502005800409520054200467520084801009520059501857520061802452590002303070650002303093650003203116690000903148690000903157710003603166773005003202790000903252791001003261792000903271793001203280856014903292AAINR8126520150317073522.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494812655  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR81265  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aChana, Tejwant Kaur.10aColonial Reproductions and Anti-Colonial Pedagogical Propositions for Educating about "the Global" in Urban Schools in India.  a222 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-03, Section: A, page: 9540.  aAdviser: Dip Kapoor.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aThe world has undergone a "great transformation" (Polanyi, 2001; [1944]) in which a global political-economic system rooted in Euro-American capitalism dominates (Chomsky, 2004; Foster, 2006; Harvey, 2003). Unlike previous centuries in which societies governed their respective economies, today, "global managers" (McMichael, 2008)/"global masters" (Stiglitz, 2003) and their "global designs" (Mignolo, 2000) rooted in centuries of "race" and racism govern "borderless" nations/societies within the present neoliberal economic framework.  aThis research focused on exploring and understanding how "the Global" is currently being addressed in education/schooling in "South/colonial" contexts, specifically in India. Within the last two decades, substantial research on globalization has emerged, however, discussions available on globalization are westerncentric. This research is linked to related areas of scholarship that are calling for more grounded qualitative studies on questions of global-local interactions and intercultural approaches given that current theories on "the Global" still do not address the array of perspectives of South nations comparatively. Within education specifically, research exploring/examining the ways in which globalization is impacting youth within schools has been heavily ignored by educational researchers as has the inquiry into "the Global".  aAn interpretivist case study approach was conducted in four schools (two Private and two Christian). Data collection consisted of focus group interviews with grade 12 secondary education students in the Commerce stream, and secondary education teachers, as well as school/classroom observations, and document analysis. The inherent use of multimethods, or triangulation, was used to identify different realities thereby accessing stronger phenomenological insights and attempting to secure an in-depth understanding of teaching about "the Global" in contemporary Indian education/schooling.  aThe findings indicate that colonialism, and colonial education, is very much alive in India through the direct influence of the World Bank and UNESCO. Just as education was historically used as a deculturing tool in the formation of the modern world system, the findings of the research indicate that this remains within Indian education today through the enforcement of neoliberal policies. The recommendation I have proposed within this study is the formation of "anti-colonial global education" (Chana, 2010) which draws on the thematics of key anti-colonial scholars both in the social sciences and education.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEducation, Policy. 4aEducation, Social Sciences.  a0458  a053420aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-03A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8126503411nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002200129245010700151300001100258500008900269500003200358502005800390520029400448520082300742520118901565590002302754650002402777690000902801710003602810773005002846790000902896791001002905792000902915793001202924856014902936AAINR8126720150317073522.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494812679  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR81267  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aBehnamian, Asian.10aThree Essays on the Canadian Bond Market: An Examination of Diversification Benefits and Yield Spread.  a113 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-03, Section: A, page: 1127.  aAdviser: Valentina Galvani.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aThe first two chapters of this thesis quantify the gains associated with portfolio diversification in the Canadian market for provincial and federal government bonds, and the third chapter examines the importance of market risk factors in explaining corporate bond yield spreads in Canada.  aThe first and second chapters answer questions such as: what are the potential benefits of investing in bonds issued by a province from the perspective of investors who already hold an efficient portfolio of Government of Canada or other provincial bonds? Furthermore, how beneficial is the additional exposure from the perspective of investors whose core interest resides in maximizing the return to risk bearing? The findings indicate that the market participants are unlikely to benefit from portfolio diversification by broadening their bond portfolio to include bonds issued by all the provinces. In particular, once realistic trading restrictions are taken into account, the benefits from the exposure to multiple provincial bond markets might be exhausted by investing in the bonds issued by one province alone.  aThe third chapter examines the importance of market risk factors in explaining the yield spreads of corporate bonds in Canada. Specifically, this chapter addresses the issue of whether corporate bond yield spreads vary systematically with the same factors that affect returns in equity and bond markets, after controlling for firm- and issue-specific characteristics. Structural models imply that the price of a corporate bond depends solely on parameters specific to the bond and the firm's financial strength. This empirical study employs hand-collected, individual Canadian corporate bonds data from January 1990 to December 2008. The sample includes 2288 individual corporate bonds observations issued by 650 corporations, which translated to 384,456 monthly observations. After controlling for firm- and issue-specific characteristics, the results indicate that betas on equity market factors have very little explanatory power. Moreover, no bond market risk factors seem to explain the corporate bond yield spreads. This chapter documents that variables inspired by structural models are the main drivers of corporate bond yield spreads, such as coupon rate, and credit ratings.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aEconomics, Finance.  a050820aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-03A.  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8126702876nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002800129245008700157300001100244500008000255500003000335502005800365520181400423590002302237650002702260690000902287710003602296773005302332790000902385791001002394792000902404793001202413856014902425AAINR8789120150317073523.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494878910  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR87891  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLynch, Karlene Heather.10aGenomic analysis and modification of Burkholderia cepacia  complex bacteriophages.  a306 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 73-12(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: Jonathan Dennis.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aThe Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a group of seventeen Gram-negative predominantly environmental bacterial species that cause potentially fatal infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Although its prevalence in these individuals is lower than that of Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the Bcc remains a serious problem in the CF community because of the transmissibility, pathogenicity, and inherent antibiotic resistance of these organisms. An alternative treatment for Bcc infections that is currently being developed is phage therapy, the clinical use of viruses that infect bacteria. In order to assess the suitability of individual phage isolates for therapeutic use, we have determined and analyzed the complete genome sequences of a panel of ten Bcc-specific phages. These sequences range from 32 to 62 kilobase pairs in length and encode a broad range of proteins with a gradient of relatedness to phage and bacterial gene products from Burkholderia and other genera. Although the majority of these phages were found not to encode virulence factors, their temperate nature may be considered a drawback with respect to their potential for use in a phage therapy protocol. To circumvent this problem, we engineered a lytic mutant of a Burkholderia pyrrocinia prophage by knocking out its putative repressor gene. The resulting phage did not form stable lysogens and was active against a CF epidemic strain in an invertebrate infection model, thus providing a proof-of-principle that temperate phages can be engineered to become lytic and that these constructs are active in vivo. Both the genomic characterization and subsequent engineering and modification of Bcc-specific phages are fundamental to the development of an effective phage therapy strategy for these bacteria.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Microbiology.  a041020aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg73-12B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR8789103410nam a2200349   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001400129245010900143300001100252500008000263500003000343502005800373520039500431520069100826520116801517590002302685650002902708650002702737690000902764690000902773710003602782773005302818790000902871791001002880792000902890793001202899856014902911AAINR9143620150317073523.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494914366  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR91436  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLiu, Lan.10aStudy of Non-Covalent Protein-Hydrophobic Ligand Complexes by Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry.  a169 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 74-04(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: John S. Klassen.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aThis thesis describes the development and application of techniques based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ES-MS) to quantify the protein-hydrophobic ligand interactions in vitro and to investigate the structure and stability of these complexes in the gas phase. Bovine beta-lactoglobulin (Lg), and its interactions with fatty acids (FA) served as model systems for this study.  aThe stoichiometry and affinity of non-covalent hydrophobic interactions between Lg and six long chain FAs in solution were evaluated using the direct ES-MS assay. Under the optimized condition, binding constants (Ka) measured for the longer FAs are in good agreement with values obtained using a fluorescence assay. However, Ka values measured for shorter FAs are significantly smaller than expected; for the shortest FA investigated, no complex ions could be detected. These findings suggest the occurrence of in-source dissociation of the complexes. However, for the shorter FAs, affinities obtained using the reference ligand method were found in good agreement with reported values.  aThe structure and stability of the gaseous deprotonated ions of the (Lg + FA) complexes were investigated using various experimental and computational methods. Rate constants and the corresponding Arrhenius parameters were determined for the loss of neutral FA from the (Lg + FA)7- ions using time-resolved blackbody infrared radiative dissociation measurements. These kinetic data, together with results of molecular dynamics simulations provide compelling evidence that the acyl chain of FAs is retained within the hydrophobic cavity of Lg in the gas phase. Comparison of the dissociation kinetics for the gaseous (Lg + FA)n- ions with those determined by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy for the complexes in water provides evidence for a late dissociative transition state for FA loss. A late dissociative transition state operating in the gas phase is also supported by results of deuterium kinetic isotope effects. Finally, the average energetic contributions of -CH3, >CH2 and -CH2=CH2- groups to the stability of the (Lg + FA)7- ions were established from the Arrhenius parameters determined for a series of saturated, unsaturated, and branched FAs.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aChemistry, Biochemistry. 4aChemistry, Analytical.  a0487  a048620aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg74-04B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9143603101nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100003500129245008600164300001100250500008000261502005800341520074300399520040101142520090501543590002302448650002902471690000902500710003602509773005302545790000902598791001002607792000902617793001202626856014902638AAINR9143920150317073523.5150317s2011    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494914397  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR91439  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aSchellenberg, Matthew Jeffrey.10aRecognition of Catalytic Structures by the Spliceosomal Proteins SF3b14 and Prp8.  a201 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 74-04(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2011.  aMore than 90% of human genes undergo a processing step called splicing, whereby non-coding introns are removed from initial transcripts and coding exons are ligated together to yield mature messenger RNA. Roughly 50% of human genetic diseases correspond to aberrant splicing. Splicing is catalyzed by an RNA/protein machine called the spliceosome. RNA components of the spliceosome are thought to be responsible for splicing catalysis, however, the vast majority of the mass of the spliceosome is composed of protein. Two such proteins, SF3b14 and Prp8 have been shown to crosslink to the sites of splicing chemistry within an intron. This thesis describes the results of structural and biochemical characterization of these two proteins.  aThe protein SF3b14 forms a complex with SF3b155. This interface modifies the RRM domain of protein so that it is capable of recognising a specific RNA structure in the spliceosome -- the BPS&middot;U2 snRNA duplex. We describe a low resolution model of this protein&middot;RNA complex using SAXS and disulfide tethering. The resulting model allows us to propose a function for the SF3b14 protein.  aThe protein Prp8 is a large (&sim;220 kDa) protein which is highly conserved from yeast to human. Despite this, very little is known with respect to the structure of this protein. Here we have further defined the previously proposed domain IV in Prp8, and identified the domain IV core. Structural determination of the domain IV core reveals an RNase H fold, which could not be predicted based on primary sequence alone. RNase H recognizes A-form nucleic acid duplexes, which strongly suggests the domain IV core interacts with double-stranded RNA in the context of the spliceosome. We characterize metal ion binding by this domain, and investigate the effect of disruption of this metal site by mutation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that metal ion binding is regulated by a conformation change of this domain, which we are able to link to a conformational change of the spliceosome during catalysis.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aChemistry, Biochemistry.  a048720aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg74-04B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2011  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9143903716nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002000129245011500149300001100264500008000275500003200355502005800387520125300445520136301698590002303061650003103084690000903115710003603124773005303160790000903213791001003222792000903232793001203241856014903253AAINR9144120150317073523.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494914410  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR91441  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLesniak, David.10aBeta1-Integrin and Resistance to Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor-2 Targeted Therapies in Breast Cancer.  a234 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 74-04(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: Bassam Abdulkarim.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aThe gene encoding human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) is overexpressed or amplified in approximately 25% of breast cancers, and is associated with aggressive disease and poor overall prognosis. In combination with chemotherapy, the standard of care for women with HER2-positive (HER-2+) breast cancer is trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the HER-2 protein. Despite prolonging disease-free and overall survival in HER-2+ patients, resistance to trastuzumab remains a major concern. Beta-1 (beta1)-integrin, an adhesion molecule involved in cell differentiation, proliferation and survival, shares common downstream signaling pathways with HER-2. In breast cancer, beta1-integrin is associated with resistance to chemo and radiation therapy, and elevated levels of beta1-integrin are commonly found in tumors enriched for epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stem cell (CSC) gene expression. Interestingly, beta1-integrin function is regulated by N-glycosylation, but the role of variant beta1-integrin N-glycoforms in EMT and drug resistance remains unknown. In this work we investigated the significance of beta1-integrin expression and N-glycosylation in response to HER-2 targeted therapies in breast cancer.  aHere we show that overexpression of beta1-integrin is an independent negative prognostic factor for tumor progression of HER-2+ metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients treated with trastuzumab-based chemotherapy. Enforced overexpression of beta1-integrin in HER-2+ breast cancer cell lines increased phosphorylation of Akt-Ser473 and ERK1/2, thereby promoting survival and mitogenic signals to bypass the anti-proliferative effects of trastuzumab. After using cloning rings to isolate clonal subpopulations from HER-2+ trastuzumab sensitive SKBR-3 cells, an EMT occurred spontaneously in several (3/8) clones. SKBR-3 EMT-clones shifted from a lumina) phenotype to a more aggressive basal/ mesenchymal phenotype and expressed decreased levels of HER-2 and a heavily N-glycosylated variant of beta1-integrin. Remarkably, inhibition of the N-glycosylated isoform of beta1-integrin restored a lumina) phenotype and impaired mammosphere formation in SKBR-3 EMT clones. When treated with relevant doses of HER-2 targeted therapies, EMT-clones showed "spontaneous" resistance, providing for the first time a direct link between EMT, N-glycosylated beta1-integrin and resistance to trastuzumab. Together our findings provide novel insight into the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance, a major problem that continues to hinder the management of HER-2+ breast cancer.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Oncology.  a099220aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg74-04B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9144104226nam a2200349   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002700129245010200156300001100258500008000269500002700349502005800376520054400434520127200978520043802250520045202688520041303140590002303553650001303576690000903589710003603598773005303634790000903687791001003696792000903706793001203715856014903727AAINR9144320150317073523.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494914434  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR91443  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLambiv Dzemua, Gideon.10aControls on the formation of Nkamouna Cobaltiferous Mn-Ni Laterite Deposit in southeast Cameroon.  a157 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 74-04(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: Sara Gleeson.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aThe weathering profile in Nkamouna, located in the Lomie Sub Division of south-east Cameroon, hosts important lateritic Co and Mn mineralization.

From serpentinite through the ferralite, the sequence shows geochemical patterns fairly typical of Ni laterite profiles and characterized by an upward decrease in MgO and SiO2 and an increase in Fe2O3, Al2O3, Cr2O3, TiO2, MnO, and CoO. Nickel is mildly enriched in the saprolite and depleted in the ferralite. The concentrations of Al2O3, MnO, CoO, and TiO2 are higher in the upper part of the ferralite and the lower breccia than in the lower part of the ferralite. The upper part of the profile is characterized by higher concentrations of SiO2, Al2O 3, TiO2, and Zr and lower concentrations of Fe2O 3, Cr2O3, MgO, MnO, CoO, and NiO relative to the ferralite. Mineralogically, the lower part of the profile is characterized by an upward decrease in the abundance of serpentine and an increase in the abundance of goethite, hematite, magnetite, and ferritchromite and the upper part by the abundance of hematite, goethite, gibbsite, kaolinite, and quartz.  aThe middle part of the profile comprising the lower breccia and the upper part of the ferralite and characterized by an abundance of lithiophorite together with admixture of other minerals common in the upper and lower parts of the profile is the main ore zone. The lithiophorite is pedogenic and is the main ore mineral and hosts most of the Co and Mn in the profile. It occurs mainly as coatings in pores and other soil components.  aThe above variations indicate the presence of a lithological discontinuity coincident with the lower breccia. The lower part of the profile is derived from the weathering of serpentinite and the upper part from a schist parentage, with the upper limonite having an admixture of exotic material including serpentinite weathering products derived from other ultramafic massifs. Nkamouna has thus evolved from a topographic low to a topographic high.  aThe serpentinite at the base of the profile is clearly not the main source of the Co and Mn present in the ore zone in Nkamouna; however, their exact source remains elusive. The location of the mineralization in the profile and the type of ore mineral is largely controlled by the ferricrete and its pedogenic characteristics. Other important factors include geology, climate, drainage, and profile maturity.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aGeology.  a037220aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg74-04B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9144303645nam a2200349   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001900129245008700148300001100235500008000246502005800326520203800384520047402422590002302896650002802919650001902947650002502966690000902991690000903000690000903009710003603018773005303054790000903107791001003116792000903126793001103135856014903146AAINR9636920150317073523.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||fre d  a9780494963692  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96369  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aGrey, Caleb L.10aGhrelin Actions and Signalling in GH and LH Release from Goldfish Pituitary Cells.  a291 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-04(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aNeuroendocrine regulation of vertebrate growth and reproduction is a multi-factorial process and includes growth hormone (GH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) release. In goldfish, the orexigenic peptide ghrelin (gGRLN 19) stimulates GH and LH release, making it a potential link between energy balance, growth, and reproduction. However, how gGRLN19 interacts with other neuroendocrine regulators of GH and LH release and its mechanisms of actions are unknown. To elucidate these aspects, I cloned a partial sequence of the gGRLN receptor (gGHS-R) and demonstrated the presence of gGHS-R mRNA, together with that for gGRLN, in goldfish brain and pituitary tissues using polymerase chain reactions. Preliminary Western blot results supported the presence of gGHS-R1-like proteins in goldfish pituitary extracts. Using goldfish pituitary cell primary cultures in cell column perifusion hormone release and fura-2, AM Ca2+-imaging studies, gGRLN19-induced GH and LH release were found to involve increases in intracellular free Ca 2+ levels via extracellular Ca2+ entry through L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels, protein kinase C, and nitric oxide. However, protein kinase A only participated in gGRLN19-induced LH release, while its activation potentiated gGRLN19-elicited GH release. Utilization of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms differed, with nNOS and iNOS participating in GH and LH responses, respectively. Pretreatment with pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) potentiated gGRLN19-induced GH, but not LH, release while pretreatment with gGRLN19 followed by PACAP did not enhance hormone secretion. gGRLN 19 increased GH release in the presence of goldfish GR-releasing hormone (gGHRH) and dopamine (DA), but potentiated GH responses were not observed. Both basal LH release and the LH responses to gGRLN19 were inhibited by gGHRH and DA. On the other hand, gGRLN19 failed to further elevate GH and LH secretion in the presence of salmon gonadotropin-releasing hormone (sGnRH) and chicken (c)GnRH-II.  aOverall, gGRLN19 induces both GH and LH release through gGHS-R mediated, cell-selective signalling pathways and exhibits complex interactions with other endogenous regulators of pituitary hormone release in a cell type-, ligand-, and treatment sequence-specifie manner. Results support the idea that gGRLN19 regulates growth and reproduction, identify gGHRH as a novel LH release inhibitor, and further our understanding of neuroendocrine regulation of these processes.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Endocrinology. 4aBiology, Cell. 4aBiology, Physiology.  a0409  a0379  a071920aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-04B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aFrench  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9636902858nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002900129245008900158300001100247500008000258502005800338520089400396520088401290590002302174650001102197650002802208690000902236690000902245710003602254773005302290790000902343791001002352792000902362793001202371856014902383AAINR9637020150317073523.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494963708  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96370  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aAllen-Trottier, Melaena.10aCanada's Roma and the "Gypsy Musicians":  Identity as Dialogue and Musical Practice.  a184 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-04(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aThis research highlights the differences and similarities in identity construction between the two most visible groups of Roma in Canada: the Romani advocates and refugees, who are based in Toronto, and Canada's Roma and non-Roma "Gypsy musicians", who are largely based in Montreal. While the Roma advocates are inextricably tied to emergent Romani nationalism, the "Gypsy musicians" are generally apolitical by choice. Since many of them are non-Roma, affiliation with "Gypsy" or "Roma" identity is voluntary, and tends to be for professional and economic advantage when it occurs. Although it seems unlikely that the two groups could be connected on any meaningful level, let alone engaged in complicated and interdependent maneuvers, they are inextricably conflated on a practical level in both personal and professional constructions of identity, which form the basis of this inquiry.  aI argue that in Canada, the Roma and non-Roma producers of "Gypsy music" products are informed by three main paradigms: Canadian national identity as manifested by social inclusivity and social welfare; Romani national (or transnational) identity, which, being historically based on an identity of "other'', is still tentative and emergent, but which at the moment is largely predicated on the need for advocacy; and a free market identity which privileges branding of the "ethnic product" in a global marketplace. In Canada and in Montreal specifically, the Romani "Gypsy musicians" display a best-case scenario of Romani integration---social mobility and integration combined with a high degree of control over personal and professional cultural identity---that remains elusive for the general Roma population of Canada, and which is virtually unheard of in European countries.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aMusic. 4aAnthropology, Cultural.  a0413  a032620aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-04A(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9637003142nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002100129245011100150300001100261500008000272502005800352520204000410590002302450650003302473650002602506690000902532690000902541710003602550773005302586790000902639791001002648792000902658793001202667856014902679AAINR9637120150317073523.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494963715  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96371  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aFriesen, Aileen.10aBuilding Orthodox Communities outside Mother Russia:  Church and Colonization in Omsk Diocese, 1885--1917.  a411 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-04(E), Section: A.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aThis dissertation examines the social, cultural, and institutional interaction of Russian Orthodox settlers, clergymen, bishops, Orthodox leaders, and state officials, both local and national, during the colonization of Siberia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The arrival of millions of peasant-settlers to the region constituted one of the Russian state's most ambitious imperial undertakings. Omsk diocese, created in 1895, and encompassing part of the Kazakh Steppe and the territory surrounding Omsk, comprised one of the destinations chosen by settlers to establish new communities. This dissertation explores Omsk diocese as a frontier, or a site of interaction, where these groups collaborated, and at times struggled, with each other as they attempted to rebuild Orthodox religious institutions and life in Siberia. While the church, state, and settlers agreed that building parishes complete with churches, priests, and schools constituted a fundamental need that must be fulfilled in order to establish a functioning community capable of perpetuating "Russian" cultural values, the process of building these parishes and engaging in Orthodox practices highlighted the tensions that existed between and among these groups. Religious pluralism, changing social identities, competing authorities, the breakdown of traditional authority in the villages, debates over the professionalization of the clerical ranks, and the bureaucratization and standardization of religious life - conditions associated with the creation of the modern world - appeared in Siberia during colonization. While many of these tensions reflected the social and cultural changes afoot in the empire, on the frontier, they took on a life of their own. This dissertation argues that the frontier created a space which forced the state, the church, and settlers to discuss and explore local and national expectations, aspirations, and fears assigned to the process of creating communities in an expanding and modernizing imperial Russia.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHistory, Russian and Soviet. 4aReligion, History of.  a0724  a032020aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-04A(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9637103535nam a2200337   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001400129245011900143300001100262500008000273502005800353520040600411520069100817520059201508520024202100520052102342590002302863650002402886690000902910710003602919773005302955790000903008791001003017792000903027793001203036856014903048AAINR9637220150317073523.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494963722  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96372  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLi, Jing.10aFunctional characterization of recombinant hyoscyamine 6beta-hydroxylase and isolation of antimicrobial compounds.  a162 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-04(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aScopolamine (3) is a tropane alkaloid that has a long history of use as a medicinal agent. The last two steps of scopolamine biosynthesis are accomplished by a bifunctional dioxygenase hyoscyamine 6beta-hydroxylase (H6H, EC 1.14.11.11). The mechanism of H6H catalysis has not been elucidated. The first part of this dissertation will describe mechanistic studies of H6H from Atropa belladonna (AbH6H).  aIn order to obtain AbH6H, the gene sequence of H6H from  Atropa belladonna was cloned into the vector pQE60 with a C-terminal His6-tag. The recombinant H6H was expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. An HPLC method was developed to detect the formation of products from the recombinant  AbH6H, allowing for the investigation of the enzymatic activity. Analogues of hyoscyamine (1), the substrate of AbH6H, were synthesized and tested for conversion and enzyme inhibition. Additionally, an 18O-labeled 6beta-hydroxyhyoscyamine (2a) was fed to purified AbH6H to probe the catalytic mechanism of the last step in the biosynthesis of scopolamine.  aAn ongoing goal of this project is to obtain the crystal structure of  AbH6H to elucidate its catalytic mechanism. In order to facilitate crystallization, cleavage of the His6-tag was attempted by introducing a tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease cleavage site at the N-terminus of the protein. The AbH6H gene with an N-terminal TEV tag was cloned into pET28a(+), and was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for protein overexpression. After obtaining the TEV tagged AbH6H, TEV protease treatment was applied. Mass spectrometry analysis suggested that the His6-tag was successfully removed.  aThe second part of this dissertation describes efforts and results of isolation and characterization of antimicrobial compounds from three sources: a strain of Bacillus licheniformis, LeucidalRTM  Liquid and from Streptomyces sp. SPS030.  aAn anticlostridial peptide was isolated from Bacillus licheniformis  Ce-7. Based on MS and NMR analysis, the peptide was found to be bacitracin A, a well known antibiotic active against Gram-positive bacteria. Salicylic acid and a didecyl dimethyl ammonium species were isolated from LeucidalRTM Liquid, which are responsible for the activity of LeucidalRTM Liquid against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, respectively. The anti-microbial compound from Streptomyces  sp. SPS030 is still under investigation.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aChemistry, Organic.  a049020aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-04B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9637203696nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002100129245006600150300001100216500008000227500002800307502005800335520106400393520158801457590002303045650002703068690000903095710003603104773005303140790000903193791001003202792000903212793001203221856014903233AAINR9640820150317073523.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964088  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96408  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aLenal, Floriane.10aAmpakine and opioid modulation of respiratory neural control.  a285 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-05(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: John J. Greer.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aThe inspiratory phase of the breathing cycle is thought to be generated by a network of neurons within a region of the ventrolateral medulla called the preBotzinger complex (preBotC). Synaptic transmission mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate acting via alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptors is critical for the normal functioning of the preBotC network and its rhythmogenic activity. Ampakines are synthetic molecules designed to readily cross the blood-brain barrier and allosterically bind to AMPA receptors (AMPARs) to modulate certain kinetics of their channel such as slowing channel closing or decreasing desensitization and/or deactivation rates. This may prolong current flow through AMPARs and enhance endogenous glutamatergic synaptic transmission. Previous studies have demonstrated that the two broad classes of ampakines (high- and low-impact) alleviate opioid-induced respiratory depression in rodents in vivo and in vitro. This thesis aimed to investigate the cellular mechanisms underlying these actions.  aI determined that the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala2, N-MePhe 4, Gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) differentially affected synaptic inputs within the preBotC. AMPA-mediated ionic currents in single preBotC neurons were potently enhanced by the high-impact ampakines CX614 and CX546 and this clearly amplified the recruitment of endogenous inspiratory-drive conductances to promote respiratory rhythmogenesis. In addition to the preBotC effects, it was determined that DAMGO may significantly suppress respiratory frequency by acting through raphe nucleus obscurus (RNO) neurons. Electrophysiological data showed that DAMGO decreased the excitability of RNO neurons. Immunohistochemical data demonstrated that mu-opioid receptors are uniquely expressed among excitatory RNO neurons. Finally, the mode of action of the low-impact ampakine CX717 (which alleviates severe opioid-induced respiratory depression) was examined. Surprisingly, CX717 showed little to no augmenting action of AMPA mediated conductances on preBotC neurons. However, it markedly increased N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA)-mediated responses that were decreased by glycine, and a high expression of the subunit NR3A was found within the preBotC. This led to my hypothesis that CX717 is acting as an allosteric modulator on the glycine binding NMDA receptor subtype NR3, known to negatively influence conventional NMDA receptor conductance. These data provide a foundation for further exploring a completely novel model of CX717 action and the previously unexplored role of NR3 function in central respiratory control.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Neuroscience.  a031720aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-05B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9640803392nam a2200313   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002900129245006800158300001100226500008000237500002800317502005800345520116500403520117301568590002302741650002702764690000902791710003602800773005302836790000902889791001002898792000902908793001202917856014902929AAINR9640920150317073524.5150317s2012    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964095  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96409  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHaurat, Maria Florencia.10aBiogenesis of Outer Membrane Vesicle in Gram Negative Bacteria.  a143 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-05(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: Mario Feldman.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2012.  aThe formation and trafficking of membrane vesicles is an essential process in eukaryotes. These structures are formed to store, traffic, or digest cellular components and virtually all the organelles of the eukaryotic cell are able to form vesicles. In prokaryotes, vesicle formation was reported several decades ago; first in Gram negative bacteria and recently in Gram positive bacteria and in archaea. In contrast to the well established multiple cellular roles of membrane vesicles in eukaryotic cell biology, outer membrane vesicles (OMV) produced via blebbing of Gram negative outer membranes (OM) have frequently been regarded as cell debris or microscopy artifacts. It has only relatively recently been acknowledged that OMV possess multiple functional roles, including response to diverse forms of stress, intra-species communication, long distance virulence factor delivery and contribution to immune system evasion. Although the importance of OMV is now established, it remains to be determined whether OMV result from a selective process or by passive disintegration of the OM as well as the mechanism(s) involved in their biogenesis and secretion.  aIn this thesis the most abundant proteins from purified OM and OMV of  Porphyromonas gingivalis and Salmonella typhimurium were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. This analysis has shown that the human oral pathogen P. gingivalis has a mechanism to selectively sort OM proteins into OMV. This process results in the preferential packaging of gingipains, a group of proteases that constitute a major virulence factor of P. gingivalis, and in the exclusion of abundant OM proteins from the protein cargo. Similar results were observed in  S. typhimurium. Moreover in P. gingivalis, OM and OMV also differed in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) composition, the OMV being enriched with tri-acylated high molecular weight LPS molecules. Furthermore, it has been shown that mutations affecting the LPS result in aberrant protein sorting into the OMV. These results assign a critical role to surface glycans in directing this sorting mechanism, equivalent to the role of galectin in eukaryotic endosomal vesicle formation. The existence of a process to pack specific virulence factors into OMV may significantly alter our current understanding of host-pathogen interactions.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aBiology, Microbiology.  a041020aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-05B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2012  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9640902948nam a2200325   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100004400129245008200173300001100255500008000266500002900346502005800375520182100433590002302254650002302277650002602300690000902326690000902335710003602344773005302380790000902433791001002442792000902452793001202461856014902473AAINR9641020150317073524.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964101  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96410  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aEspinaco-Virseda, Angeles Pilar Helene.10aOf Beasts and Men: Identities, Zoos and "Civilization" in Germany, 1858-1914.  a433 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-05(E), Section: A.  aAdviser: Dennis Sweeney.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aThis dissertation uses animals as a lens to examine the forces and changes affecting Germany between approximately 1860 and 1914. It suggests the centrality of animals to the construction of modern German identity, an identity characterized by extremely porous and unstable boundaries forged in relation to the shifting categories of race, class, and species. Although the Cologne Zoo is briefly examined, this study is mainly located in Hamburg, where the city's two zoos formed a nexus of national trends and international trade. Together the city and the zoos unite the various strands of business, industry, politics, science, colonialism and public life that constituted the German middle classes, which formed at the intersection of the transnational and cross-border flows and global transformations associated with "the modern." Close readings of published and archival sources illuminate the practices and discourses of zoo keeping at the Hamburg Zoological Garden and Hagenbeck's  Tierpark (Animal Park) against the imperialist discourses of several publications (a memoir by Alfred Tetens' memoir and a scientific journal) related to the Hamburg based Godeffroy Shipping Company. In particular, the figure of Carl Hagenbeck reified middle-class German values and ideals and his popularization of humane training (Zahm Dressur) for circuses and his innovations in animal display exemplified the dynamics of the ideal imperial-colonial relationship. Also, an analysis of contemporary anthropomorphism shows the relative and constantly shifting nature of class, race and species identities within the context of Darwinism and colonial-imperialism, which transnational culture brought into focus. These blurred and unstable identities call the fixity and definition of the human identity itself into question.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHistory, European. 4aLiterature, Germanic.  a0335  a031120aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-05A(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9641003808nam a2200337   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002000129245013300149300001100282500008000293500002500373502005800398520061000456520028101066520088101347520088902228590002303117650004303140690000903183710003603192773005303228790000903281791001003290792000903300793001203309856014903321AAINR9641120150317073524.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964118  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96411  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aWilletts, Lian.14aThe Role of VAMP-7-Mediated Events in Eosinophil Degranulation: Implications from Animal Models of Allergic Airway Inflammation.  a207 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-05(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: Paige Lacy.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aBackground: Eosinophil degranulation has been implicated in the development of inflammation in allergic asthma. Expressed by human and mouse eosinophils, VAMP-7 is a SNARE complex protein that has been shown to participate in receptor-mediated degranulation in many cell types including human mast cells, natural killer cells, and eosinophils. In this project, it was hypothesized that VAMP-7 is critical in eosinophil degranulation, and that deletion of the VAMP-7 gene in eosinophils will result in changes in one or more eosinophil effector functions in the development of allergic airway inflammation.  aObjective: The role of VAMP-7 in eosinophil degranulation was studied using in vitro and ex vivo  assays. The implication of VAMP-7-mediated events in the development of pathology and airway hyperresponsiveness was evaluated in the mouse model of allergic airway inflammation.  aMethod: Eosinophil-specific VAMP-7 deficiency was generated using the Cre-LoxP binary system. Eosinophils were isolated from the peripheral blood of progeny carrying a Cre-recombined null VAMP-7 allele. VAMP-7-deficient eosinophils were tested for degranulation using in vitro stimulation with platelet-activating factor and ionomycin. VAMP-7-deficient eosinophils were also stimulated by adoptive transfer into airways of interleukin-5 and human eotaxin-2 double transgenic mice lacking EPX. Lung function and disease pathology were evaluated in eosinophil-specific VAMP-7-deficient mice treated with an ovalbumin sensitization and challenge protocol that induced disease-like phenotype in mouse airways. Levels of eosinophil crystalloid granule proteins (i.e., EPX, MBP, and Ears) and immunoregulatory cytokines (IL-14 and IL-13) were tested in supernatants and BAL samples.  aResults: Using the eCre-LoxP binary system, a highly efficient Cre-mediated activity was achieved that resulted in VAMP-7 gene deletion in eosinophils. VAMP-7-deficient eosinophils demonstrated a significant reduction in granule protein release  in vitro. This reduction in secretion was reflected in three different types of eosinophil crystalloid granule proteins evaluated. Significant reduction in secreted EPX from VAMP-7-deficient eosinophils was confirmed following adoptive airway transfer into airways of IL-5/hE2/EPX-/- mice. Using mouse models of allergic airway inflammation, the contribution of VAMP-7-mediated degranulation from mouse eosinophils was demonstrated in vivo. Preliminary findings suggest that VAMP-7-mediated degranulation from airway eosinophils is important in establishing the pathology and airway hyperresponsiveness in mouse models of allergic asthma.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Medicine and Surgery.  a056420aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-05B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9641103276nam a2200349   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100001700129245006300146300001100209500008000220502005800300520024700358520055200605520047301157520092201630590002302552650003102575650002402606690000902630690000902639710003602648773005302684790000902737791001002746792000902756793001202765856014902777AAINR9641220150317073524.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964125  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96412  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aCai, Jianan.10aExperiments on Sand Jets, Viscoplastic Fluids and Pumping.  a196 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-05(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aThis study aims to improve our understanding of physical processes related to MFT and sand operations in tailings ponds. Laponite, a synthetic silicate that produces a transparent non-Newtonian gel, was used as a laboratory substitute of MFT.  aThis thesis first discussed the results of an experimental study of circular sand jets in air from nozzles of various sizes. The frontal speeds of the sand jets and the steady sand jet velocity accelerate due to gravity with negligible air resistance. The diameters of sand jets decrease but gradually approach an asymptotic value and the sand concentration in the jet decreases as the distance from the nozzle increases. Waves were observed at the periphery of the sand jet and some preliminary results of wave speed and wavelength were reported.  aIn second part of this thesis, experiments were carried out by depositing circular sand jets vertically into viscoplastic fluids. The deformation regimes of sand jets in the gel were investigated, including dispersed jetting, confined jetting and dripping. The penetration of sand drops at the gel surface was monitored and a simplified model was proposed to predict the yield stress. The yield-gravity parameter of the deformed sand drop in the gel was also computed.  aAnother set of experiments were performed to withdraw viscoplastic Laponite gel or water capped gel from a vertical circular pipe by a progressive cavity pump. The gel velocity field was computed from the images taken during the process. Under the assumption of an axisymmetric flow condition, radial velocity was found to vary with the axial angle and maximum horizontal velocity occurs at a level below the intake pipe. For pumping a single layer of gel, an analytical solution was proposed to describe the radial velocity variation induced by pumping and it shows a good agreement with the experimental data when axial angle is less than 150&deg;. For the selective withdrawal of water and gel, the interface deformation was inspected and critical submergence was found to be mainly controlled by the withdraw discharge. Water and gel discharges were discussed in terms of the subcritical and supercritical stages.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aWater Resource Management. 4aEngineering, Civil.  a0595  a054320aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-05B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9641203473nam a2200301   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002800129245008000157300001100237500008000248502005800328520077000386520166001156590002302816650004502839690000902884710003602893773005302929790000902982791001002991792000903001793001203010856014903022AAINR9641320150317073524.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964132  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96413  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHumphries, Serena Lynn.10aBuilding management capacity for evidence use in health care organizations.  a226 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-05(E), Section: B.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aHealth care organizations face challenges using evidence to inform program management decisions. A number of factors influence the use of evidence by program managers, including: individual skills, organizational context, organizational culture and decision-making processes. While it is recognized that health care organizations require strategies to promote the use of evidence in program planning, implementation and evaluation, there is a paucity of research on ways to achieve this. The purpose of this thesis is to critically examine the use of evidence in planning, implementing and evaluating programs within health care organizations. It contains a series of four papers that collectively explore the use of evidence to inform program management decisions.  aThe first paper is a review synthesizing the literature on barriers and facilitators to evidence-informed decision-making experienced by decision-makers at the program level within health care organizations. The second paper provides an overview of a collaborative initiative between two Canadian health care organizations and a University partner to build organizational capacity for evidence-use in program planning, implementation and evaluation. The third paper explores the use of evidence to inform decisions in two programs in two different health care organizations through a participatory action research project. Research methods include: documentation review, key informant interviews and focus groups. The opportunity to examine the use of evidence in health care organizations through this partnership initiative provide insight into strategies to build organizational capacity to use evidence to inform management decision-making. The fourth paper presents the development of a model to support evidence use in program management within health care organizations. Through a review of theoretical and empirical research on evidence-use by decision-makers at the program level in health care organizations a model illustrating the organizational resources, tools and supports needed to support the use of evidence in program development, implementation and evaluation is developed. The model builds on and enhances the knowledge to action process by overlaying the organizational tools, resources and supports that are required to operationalize the knowledge to action process at the program management level within health care organizations.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Health Care Management.  a076920aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-05B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9641303847nam a2200385   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002000129245012100149300001100270500008000281500002900361502005800390520082600448520173801274590002303012650003003035650002903065650002903094650002403123690000903147690000903156690000903165690000903174710003603183773005303219790000903272791001003281792000903291793001203300856014903312AAINR9641420150317073524.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964149  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96414  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aVarkey, Mathew.10aDevelopment of Novel Non-Scarring Tissue Engineered Skin to Treat Burn Patients and Others with Extensive Skin Loss.  a227 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-05(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: Edward Tredget.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aTissue engineered skin containing autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes on collagen-glycosaminoglycan (C-GAG) matrices are the preferred skin substitutes for wound repair when loss of skin is extensive as in burns. A significant negative outcome of wound healing is hypertrophic scarring (HTS), a dermalfibroproliferative disorder, that leads to considerable morbidity. Dermal fibroblasts, the cells that mediate wound healing and HTS are heterogeneous; they consist of superficial (SF), deep (DF) and hair follicle fibroblasts. Previous studies have shown that DF maybe responsible for HTS. The goal of this project was therefore to further characterize SF and DF, explore new targets for treatment of HTS and develop tissue engineered skin with anti-scarring properties, for use in patients with extensive skin loss.  aBiochemical and biomechanical assessment of C-GAG matrices independently seeded with SF or DF revealed differential matrix remodelling. Matrices with DF were more contracted and stiffer and had significantly higher osteopontin, angiotensin-II, peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha, and significantly less tumor necrosis factor-alpha, PPAR-beta/delta/, PPAR-gamma, and the proteoglycan, fibromodulin compared to matrices with SF. These targets could potentially be used for treatment of HTS. Further, when SF or DF were independently co-cultured with keratinocytes on matrices, the resulting engineered skin with SF formed a continuous epidermis with increased epidermal barrier function and higher levels of keratin-5 and E-cadherin, compared to that with DF, which had an intermittent epidermis. Also, engineered skin with SF formed better basement membrane with more laminin-5, nidogen, collagen typeVII, and the proteoglycan, perlecan, compared to that with DF. Furthermore, assessment of epidermal effect on matrix remodelling by SF and DF revealed a significant keratinocytes-mediated inhibition of matrix contraction, TGF-beta1 and collagen production, and myofibroblast-differentiation for DF and not for SF. Also, co-culture of keratinocytes resulted in reduced gene expression of pro-fibrotic, CTGF and fibronectin and increased expression of anti-fibrotic, MMP-1, decorin and fibromodulin for DF and not SF. Taken together, the specific use of SF in tissue engineered skin may be more beneficial than heterogeneous dermal fibroblasts to promote adhesion of newly-formed skin and anti-fibrotic wound healing, and promising for use in treatment of extensive skin loss and other basement membrane disorders.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aHealth Sciences, Surgery. 4aEngineering, Biomedical. 4aChemistry, Biochemistry. 4aBiology, Histology.  a0576  a0541  a0487  a041420aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-05B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR9641403436nam a2200349   4500001001100000005001700011008004100028020001800069035002300087040001900110100002900129245011200158300001100270500008000281500003100361502005800392520057700450520041101027520059301438520052402031520019502555590002302750650002602773690000902799710003602808773005302844790000902897791001002906792000902916793001202925856014902937AAINR9641520150317073524.5150317s2013    ||||||||||||||||| ||eng d  a9780494964156  a(MiAaPQ)AAINR96415  aMiAaPQcMiAaPQ1 aHoldsworth, Amber Marie.14aThe axisymmetric collapse of a mixed region and internal wave generation in stratified and rotating fluids.  a116 p.  aSource: Dissertation Abstracts International, Volume: 75-05(E), Section: B.  aAdviser: Bruce Sutherland.  aThesis (Ph.D.)--University of Alberta (Canada), 2013.  aThis thesis examines the axisymmetric collapse of a mixed region in stratified fluid with and without rotation. At its depth of neutral buoyancy, the mixed region intrudes into the ambient. At the same time, the collapse excites internal waves in the underlying fluid and at the level of the propagating intrusion. The purpose of this thesis is twofold: to examine the evolution of axisymmetric intrusions in stratified fluid and to analyze the properties of downward propagating internal waves excited during the collapse. This is done through three interrelated studies.  aFirst we present a series of axisymmetric partial-depth lock-release experiments in uniformly stratified fluid. We show that the collapse excites internal waves in the underlying fluid and measure the resulting conical wavefield using a non-intrusive analysis technique called synthetic Schlieren. We also estimate the energy transported due to the waves relative to the initial available potential energy.  aThe second study investigates the dynamics of the evolving intrusion for both two-layer and uniformly stratified ambient. Experiments were performed with the fluid in solid body rotation and in the absence of rotation. In the non-rotating experiments, we show that the intruding fluid is significantly influenced by interactions with internal waves launched by the return flow of the ambient into the lock. We describe how the evolution of the collapse changes under the influence of rotation and find that, for low Rossby numbers, rotation inhibits the radial propagation of the current.  aThe third study examines the influence of rotation on downward propagating internal waves generated by the collapse of a mixed region in uniformly stratified fluid. Experiments are used to calibrate a numerical model which we then use to explore a wider range of parameters than the geometric constraints of the experimental apparatus would allow. In particular, we explore the influence of the aspect ratio of the lock and the Rossby number on the properties of the canonical wavefield and associated energy transport.  aThese results are then extrapolated to predict the energy transport of downward propagating internal waves generated by the collapse of a mixed region left in the wake of a tropical cyclone.  aSchool code: 0351. 4aAtmospheric Sciences.  a072520aUniversity of Alberta (Canada).0 tDissertation Abstracts Internationalg75-05B(E).  a0351  aPh.D.  a2013  aEnglish  uhttp://gateway.proquest.com/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&res_dat=xri:pqm&rft_dat=xri:pqdiss:NR96415
