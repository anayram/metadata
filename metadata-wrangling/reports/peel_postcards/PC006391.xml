	/mods/note	The Kid has Gone to the Colors.
The kid has gone to the colors, and we don't know what to say: The kid we have loved and cuddled, stepped out for the flag to-day. We thought him a child, a baby, with never a care at all; but his country called him man-size - and the kid has hear the call.
He paused to watch the recruiting, where, fired by the fife and drum, he bowed his head to Old Glory, and thought that it whispered: "Come!" The Kid, not being a slacker, stood forth with patriot-joy, to add his name to the roster - And, God! we're proud of the boy!
The kid has gone to the colors; it seems but a little while, since he drilled a schoolboy army, in a truly martial style. But now he's a man, a soldier, and we lend him a listening ear; for his heart is a heart all loyal, unscourged by the curse of fear.
His dad, when he told him, shuddered, his mother - God bless her! - cried; yet blest with a mother-nature, she wept with a mother-pride. But he whose old shoulders straightened was granddad - for memory ran to years when he, too, a youngster, was changed by the flag to a man! - W.M.
