	/mods/note	Lake View Park was a planned, estates-style community that was to be part of Lake View Heights. This is an artist's rendition of the proposed lake with the proposed community surrounding it. Streets are laid out and the lake is surrounded by trees. Fountains, boats and buildings are depicted on and around the lake. Mountains and cityscape in the background. Lake View Heights is described in the Henderson?s Directory for 1913 as being near the north city limits west of 19th Street NE. It is shown on maps as north and east of the Tuxedo Park area, roughly where the old airport was (now McCall industrial Park) The 1913 Henderson?s directory lists no residents. This appears to have been one of those districts that were registered and approved by the city but were never developed. No services existed, nor were there any plans for them and roads were only barely adequate.	fsalehi	PC006096	postcards	11	3.2
