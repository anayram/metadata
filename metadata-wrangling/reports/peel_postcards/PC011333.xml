The 1st church was built in 1892, & the current church, completed in 1914, was erected on the site of the first Catholic mission in Prince Albert, near the banks of the North Saskatchewan River. The Cathedral was designed in the Romanesque style, with buttresses to help to support the walls. The red brick church is accented with light Manitoba Tyndall stone. The niche in the apex of the roof holds a bronze statue of the Sacred Heart which was a gift from the people of Montmartre, France.	fsalehi	PC011333	postcards	5	3.3
