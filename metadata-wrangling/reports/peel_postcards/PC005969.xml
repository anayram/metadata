	/mods/note	Memorial Park, Belcher Hospital, Calgary. Taken from the Public Library, this lovely ornamental park is located along Twelfth Avenue, between Second and Fourth Streets West. Rest seats, well kept lawns, neatly trimmed hedges, shrubs and geometrical flower beds are much enjoyed by the citizens and visitors. This park is also within close access of the patients and convalescents of the New Belcher Hospital, which can be seen in the background. This hospital was opened in 1943 to provide medical care and occupational therapy for War Veterans. On the left is First Baptist Church one of the many lovely churches in the City. The Equestrian Monument in the centre of the Park has been dedicated in memory of the brave men of Alberta who fell in the South Africa War 1899-1902. Directly behind this monument is the Cenotaph War Memorial 1914-1918. The City Fathers and The Calgary horticultural Society have contributed largely in developing the "City Beautiful" campaign by encouraging the beautification of parks, home surroundings and cultivation of gardens.	fsalehi	PC005969	postcards	7	3.2
