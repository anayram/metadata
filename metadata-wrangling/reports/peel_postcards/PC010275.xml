	/mods/note	Promotional picture of the York Hotel with the Red Ensign flying from the top corner of the hotel. Opened in 1930 with 180 rooms on a site formally occupied by Knox Presbyterian Church and Calgary's first oil stock exchange. It suffered fire damage in the early 70's and was extensively renovated. In 1993 Calhome Poperties acquired the building and converted the upper space to self contained housing for low income single persons. In 2006 Encana chose this site to build a new downtown headquarters. Conservation of the hotel's facade was undertaken and will be incorporated into the new building which will be called 'The Bow" This new building was designed by Foster and Partners.	fsalehi	PC010275	postcards	7	3.2
