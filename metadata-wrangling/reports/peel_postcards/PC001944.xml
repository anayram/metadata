	/mods/note	[front inside panel]: Holy Trinity Church. On the Fourth of November next, Holy Trinity Parish will celebrate its "Diamond Jubilee," the first church having been opened on November 4, 1868. The population of Winnipeg at that time was some two hundred people and Holy Trinity was the first church to be built in the town. She has carried on continuously since that time and today the Parish comprises three-quarters of the main business section and the most congested residential portion of the City. The membership is scattered throughout Greater Winnipeg. In order to preserve a record of all who name Holy Trinity as their Church, a special "Diamond Jubilee" membership roll book has been prepared in which to enter the names. All members are specially requested to sign the return portion of this card and send it to the Parish Office, for this purpose. Any who so desire, may personally sign the Membership Roll in the Vestry of the Church, at their convenience. D.C. MacLachlan, People's Warden, C.
