	/mods/note	The fish hatchery and residence were built in 1928 by Oland and Scott Construction, and the hatchery began operation in 1929 with the completion of additional facilities. The residence was a five-room cottage. The buildings were located on Highway 6, about 1/4 mile from the park entrance building. The buildings were intentionally designed to be showpieces in the park. The frame buildings featured fieldstone lower walls and chimeys that were complemented by the garden wall, also made of fieldstone. Decorative eyebrow dormers and a half-timbered front porch enlivened the design and kept with the rustic architectural theme of the major public buildings in the park. The superintendent's residence was destoyed by fire, and replaced in 1962-1963. That house was in turn removed from the site in the spring of 2007. The fish hatchery ceased operation in 1960.	fsalehi	PC009229	postcards	9	3.2
