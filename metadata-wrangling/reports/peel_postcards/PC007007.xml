I wrote to your mother before going to the Welsh meeting so now before I go to bed I will just scribble on this card. We had a fine little meeting, although we only numbered 9. I have had a very pleasant xmas indeed, but it would have been hundred times pleasanter had I spent it at 82 Regent St. The Duke was here a short time ago. I had the pleasure of seeing him, also I saw Princess Patricia of Battenburg. Had a letter from Lis to-day. Not a word from you this week as yet but no doubt I shall receive something before Saturday. Best Love. Hari	bstearns	PC007007	postcards	8	3.2
