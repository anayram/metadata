	/mods/note	Side angle view of the Braemar Lodge at 215 4th Avenue SW. A wagon is partly visible on the street in front of the hotel, to the left. The neighbouring house belonged to D.W. Marsh, who built the Braemar as the home of the Anglican Bishop of Calgary, Bishop Pinkham in 1892. Bishop's Court, as it was known, was purchased in 1904 by the Mollison sisters and renovated to become a fashionable hotel It was run by Annie Mollison until her death in 1929. It changed hands a number of times and burned down during demolition in 1965. The cupola just visible in the background is that of the Central School.	bstearns	PC010170	postcards	6	3.2
