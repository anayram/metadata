	/mods/note	Post Office and Manitoba Free Press buildings on the south side of Portage Avenue between Fort and Garry Streets. Date of images appears to be mid-1920s at latest, given presence of a branch of the Union Bank, which was absorbed into the Royal Bank of Canada on Sept. 1, 1925, in this image (in the former Manitoba Free Press Building). Note also the sign for Black & Armstrong Realty between the second and third floors of the building -- a company that is still located on Portage Avenue (in the Sterling Building).	fsalehi	PC011542	postcards	4	3.3
