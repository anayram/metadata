	/mods/note	I hope you got the letter I sent all right. I will try and send some Cards to Edith & Gladys if I can think of it. What do you think of this town. It has a population of about 30,000 people and it is a very busy place. It is some dusty here and there are very few shade trees here. how would you all like to line out here. The weather is nice quite a bit of sunshine. What do you think. I run across a neighbor of Uncle Geos at Brantford McKinnen who just come out. Well I must say I found out Mrs Favor your neighbor and I called on them. I am also going up this afternoon for a while. Well good bye I will write again.	fsalehi	PC005743	postcards	5	3.2
