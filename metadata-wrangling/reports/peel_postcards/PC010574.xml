	/mods/note	The first major building in Jasper townsite, the information centre once housed the park?s administrative offices, a museum and the park superintendent?s home. Architect A.M. Calderon?s design made use of local materials such as cobblestone and timber. Completed in 1914, this picturesque building helped set the tone of early development in Jasper and became a landmark, especially for visitors who arrived by train. It is one of the finest examples of rustic architecture in the National Parks, and was designated a National Historic Site in 1994.	fsalehi	PC010574	postcards	6	3.2
