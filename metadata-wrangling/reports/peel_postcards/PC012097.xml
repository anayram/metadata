	/mods/note	July 25th, Received your card this AM. I see by it you are having a good time. I slept at your place Wed & Thursday nights. My brother & his wife left here for the coast this morning. I am sure glad to be alone again. I seen Bill come in Wed & Thursday early 12 PM very quiet. I asked him in the morning for breakfast but he did not come. I did not see him to day. I was up early 6.30 AM. We had a nice rain last night & its not so hot to day., Are you coming down for the Wedding? I met Mrs Fraser on the street & she thinks you should. May be you will change your mind yet. I thought I would go in & put the dust mop over the floor next week in case company comes. It will be getting dirty by that time.	sfarnel	PC012097	postcards	7	3.3
