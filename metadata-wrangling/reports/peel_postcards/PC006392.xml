	/mods/note	Ten ways to kill an organization. 1. Miss as many meetings as you can. 2. If you do attend, don't come on time, but late. 3. If the weather is not fine, don't think of going. 4. If you attend, be sure to find fault with the work of officers and other members. 5. Decline all offices, as it is easier to criticize than to do things. 6. Get sore if you are not put on a committee or if appointed, don't attend meetings. 7. If Chair asks your opinion, tell him you have none, but later tell others what should have been done. 8. Do nothing except that absolutely necessary, and when others roll up their sleeves to help matters, howl because of the clique running things. 9. Delay your dues as long as you can, and delay answering all letters. 10. Don't bother about getting new members - "Let George do it." 54-7-20	bstearns	PC006392	postcards	9	3.2
