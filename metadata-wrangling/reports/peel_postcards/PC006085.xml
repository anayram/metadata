	/mods/note	May 29th, Dear Mother, Just a card to let you know I am doing nicely. Have not been able to sit up yet but expect to be able to go home from here on Wed. Our dear little girl was just left us for one week. Poor Will had to sit by her with the nurse himself and her mother not able to do one little thing for her. Will was with her till she passed away. They brought her down to me just after she was washed and I had her in my arms for a while. It was so hard to give her up. But God's will is best so we are both trying to say Thy Will not ours be done. She is a sweet little Angel waiting to welcome us home when our time comes. We had her Christened the first Sunday we called her Lillian Jean Will & Gordon wanted Jean. Gordon was clear beside himself over his little sister Jean he was so proud to think he had a sister to play with he comes up to see me every day now can come up himself now after school. Will comes up 2 & 3 times a day. every one has been so kind. Will write a letter when I feel better and get home. With love, Jean.	sfarnel	PC006085	postcards	10	3.2
